## About [ChainGPT AI](https://docs.chaingpt.org/overview/i.-introduction)

<details>

<summary><strong>What is ChainGPT?</strong> </summary>

ChainGPT is an advanced AI model that assists individuals and businesses with everything related to Crypto and Blockchain technology. Access unlimited solutions and use cases using our advanced AI model: Blockchain analytics, AI trading, smart-contract development, AI auditing, risk management, crypto news source, etc.

</details>

<details>

<summary>When will ChainGPT be available?</summary>

ChainGPT is currently in its beta stages, and we're working diligently to expand our final AI model. In its beta stage, ChainGPT is free for individuals and not yet accessible for developers and businesses via API. Once our utility token is released, we will make the 1.0 version available and SDK & API available for individuals, developers, and businesses. At that stage, ChainGPT will no longer be free, and users will have various pricing options.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Can I use ChainGPT now?</strong></summary>

We have developed an early beta model for ChainGPT's AI. As a result, individuals and businesses can begin exploring the use cases and solutions our advanced AI model can offer [here](https://app.chaingpt.org/).

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What is the cost to use ChainGPT?</strong></summary>

In its beta stage, ChainGPT will be open for access to individuals of the general public for free. After launching the $CGPT token, we will integrate it into the ecosystem and will release the v1.0 SDK and API for developer and institutional access. At this point, the free model will no longer be available, and users will select their desired option from the pricing plans [here](https://www.chaingpt.org/pricing).

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>How does ChainGPT work?</strong></summary>

Users prompt ChainGPT with a specific question within the domain of crypto, blockchain, or Web3. The prompt is then fed to and processed by the ChainGPT neural network. ChainGPT then produces a maximally relevant response based on three factors: the accuracy of the input, the novelty of the input, and the depth of its own knowledge. The output will be provided in the form of natural language text.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What services can ChainGPT help with?</strong></summary>

ChainGPT is extremely flexible, its functionality is bounded only by the creativity of its user. Among its unique features are: Blockchain & Crypto information, no-code smart contract generator, smart-contract auditor, code debugger, code-to-words, documentation creator, chart analysis & technical analysis, AML features, Blockchain analytics, on-chain live data, source of news, and much more. By creating the most advanced AI model, we offer users unlimited use cases to which ChainGPT can be applied. Furthermore, our SDK & API service makes it possible to develop new applications powered by ChainGPT or integrate them into existing ones.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What is the difference between ChainGPT and ChatGPT?</strong></summary>

Fundamentally, the difference exists across two paradigms, depth and recency. As it related to the depth, ChainGPT is purpose-built from data relevant to the crypto, blockchain, and Web3 industry, whereas ChatGPT is more general. This makes ChainGPT an expert on the subject matter, while ChatGPT remains less accurate. Given the fact that ChatGPT is composed of less than 1% of its knowledge base built on crypto, ChatGPT is notorious for producing false positives and commingling unrelated information. Recency relates to the freshness of information that a model provides. ChainGPT is live, constantly pulling the most up-to-date on-chain data, and information from news, and research reports; making sure information is only provided from the most accurate sources. On the other hand, ChatGPT is severely limited by its innate disconnection from the Internet, the information it provides tends to be wrong because it is out of tune with recent events.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is ChainGPT using OpenAI's API?</summary>

No. While both of these applications have a similar underlying technology (large language model) ChainGPT is purpose-built from scratch.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is the ChainGPT AI model open-source?</summary>

As an innovation based in the blockchain space, ChainGPT intends to uphold the promises of an open, decentralized ecosystem. In order to do so, we will be open-sourcing our model at a later stage. As a means of protecting the community and deterring malicious actors, the current source code shall remain accessible only to the developing team. After a certain qualitative threshold is met, the public shall gain access.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What are the legal terms on the NFTs generated by ChainGPT in my collection?</summary>

Once an NFT is minted, it becomes a form of digital property owned by the minting account On-Chain, ChainGPT does not have any claims to the work. Regarding legal ramifications, all work is subject to the individual laws of the jurisdictions in which users reside.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What are the legal terms of the Smart Contracts generated by ChainGPT?</summary>

Smart contracts that are generated by ChainGPT’s AI are fully owned by the user. Legality relating to IP such as copyrights, trademarks, and so on is subject to the laws of the jurisdiction in which the user is residing.
