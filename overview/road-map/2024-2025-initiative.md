# 2024-2025 Initiative

\
**In 2024 and 2025**, our unwavering commitment is to expand our solutions, elevate existing LLMs, and tailor new ones to meet the specialized needs of web3 applications. Our pivotal endeavor is the creation of a bespoke Layer-1 blockchain meticulously designed for the training and execution of AI models. This blockchain is engineered with a primary focus on decentralized AI applications, diverging from the conventional emphasis on cryptocurrencies. It is conceived to be semi-EVM compatible, accommodating coding languages such as Solidity, Rust, and Python. Stay tuned for comprehensive insights through forthcoming research papers and developer documentation as our theory matures into concrete development.

**2024 initiates the dynamic ChainGPT Blockchain & Ecosystem Development Phase**, commencing with the Testnet Phase. We introduce a dedicated Layer-1 blockchain meticulously designed for AI smart contracts and models. The rollout of the ChainGPT chain's testnet version marks a significant milestone, and we actively engage with our ecosystem partners to seamlessly integrate the chain into their protocols, soliciting their invaluable feedback. To foster innovation, a grant program incentivizes projects within the ChainGPT chain ecosystem. We also provide an array of indispensable tools, including an explorer, AI Models & Tools Marketplace, web wallet, wallet extension, mobile app integration, custom Remix for ChainGPT Blockchain, a wormhole (bridge) connecting to other chains, and integration with popular DEXs & CEXs.

**The subsequent Mainnet Phase spanning 2024-2025 involves** strategic collaborations with esteemed validators and capital providers to fortify the growth of our Layer-1 chain. Our foremost objectives encompass deploying the ChainGPT chain onto the mainnet, orchestrating the smooth migration of partner protocols from the testnet to the mainnet, and introducing all our in-house ecosystem applications to the mainnet, heralding a transformative era of AI-powered blockchain technology.

We aim to release the Layer-1 Chain (Mainnet Version) during the next "bull run" cycle or after the next Bitcoin halving.
