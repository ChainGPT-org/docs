There will be a single page listing all projects and dedicated pages for each project providing a detailed breakdown of scores and factors.
* [ ] **ROI Prediction with AI / Machine Learning:** We are developing a unique AI model to predict the ROI of projects based on various parameters. Initially, it will be used internally by the launchpad team for project filtering. Once its accuracy is verified, we plan to make it publicly available.
