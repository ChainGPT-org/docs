### **Q1-Q2:**

**General Ecosystem Updates:**

* [ ] **Mobile App Release:** The initial version of ChainGPTâ€™s mobile app will be released with the following features: AI NFT Generator, ChainGPT Pad, all AI tools, DAO, staking, cross-chain swapping, and a built-in Crypto wallet. The app will allow wallet import and creation, as well as a wallet connect feature with other apps. The ChainGPT App is designed to be an all-in-one stop shop for ChainGPTâ€™s infrastructure and AI solutions.&#x20;
* [x] **ChainGPTâ€™s AI Bot on Twitter ( AI Agent )**: A Twitter bot that can be tagged for quick responses directly on Twitter. Similarly to the Telegram bot, and our web-app bot, users can tag the bot to answer any questions, generate NFTs, explain Web3 related tweet, research reports, and more. \[Two AI Agents were released by ChainGPT, x.com/ChainGPTAI & x.com/ChainGPTAINews]&#x20;
* [ ] **Live Customer Support v2:** ChainGPT is enhancing customer service across all ecosystem products by implementing a live chat support feature, which will extend beyond Telegram and Discord. Live customer support will be available on every web page (powered by ZenDesk).
* [ ] **AI Chatbot Available Across All Platforms:** ChainGPT's AI Chatbot will be implemented on every webpage, giving users quick answers to any questions. It will be conveniently located next to the live customer support button.\


**AI NFT Generator:**

* [x] **Events Features Business Development**: During this period, our focus will be on enhancing the events features from a business perspective. We aim to onboard more partners to provide exciting rewards for our community and users participating in NFT minting events. This strategy builds on the success of our collaboration with TrustWallet for their 7th anniversary (see details: [nft.chaingpt.org/events/all](https://nft.chaingpt.org/events/all)).
* [ ] **Tipping Feature for Artists:** New feature to allow users to tip their favorite creators on the platform.

**Crypto AI Hub:**

* [ ] **Expanded Audit Solutions**: Enhance the Smart Contract Auditor tool by providing users with a concise audit report for free and offering a premium option for an in-depth audit report in PDF format spanning 20-40+ pages.
* [ ] **Interactive Token Charts for AI Chatbot:** Incorporate interactive charts to visually represent token data, enhancing user insights beyond text-based information.
* [ ] **AI Trading Assistant Prediction Model Release:** This model update will offer predictions of future technical analysis patterns that have yet to happen. The first release version will support top crypto coins with historical data of approx 5 or more years (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB, etc)
* [ ] **AI Trading Assistant Prediction Model Expanded:** Expansion of the prediction model to more crypto coins beyond the initial top #5 coins. The aim is to support any relevant coin within the top #1,000 on CMC, as long as they have enough data for accurate results.
* [ ] **AI Market Monitoring & Analysis:** This AI engine continuously tracks and analyzes market activity, focusing on unusual fluctuations in individual token prices. When a tokenâ€™s price rises or falls significantly beyond its category index, the AI activates an in-depth analysis to determine the cause of this sudden shift. It gathers relevant data, uncovers potential triggers, and generates a detailed research report with insights explaining the anomaly.
* [ ] **AI Crypto Legal & Compliance Assistant:** An AI model built to provide comprehensive support for crypto-related regulations, compliance policies, and laws worldwide. This AI continuously updates with the latest developments in global crypto, blockchain, and Web3 regulations, ensuring users stay informed. Designed for both individuals and businesses, it offers tailored guidance to navigate complex regulatory landscapes, helping reduce legal risks and streamline compliance efforts. (Disclaimer: This product was not designed to provide legal advice or replace legal teams, please confirm any legal decision you make with your legal council).

**LLMs & TTIMs:**

* [ ] **Enhanced Solidity LLM (Contract Generation) Release:** New and improved Solidity LLM from ChainGPT AI, with high capability. We believe this will be the most advanced AI model for Solidity coding.
* [ ] **ROI Prediction with AI / Machine Learning:** We are developing a unique AI model to predict the ROI of projects based on various parameters. Initially, it will be used internally by the launchpad team for project filtering. Once its accuracy is verified, we plan to make it publicly available. This feature will likely be accessible to Diamond members and integrated into the research page, displaying ROI predictions alongside project scores.

**ChainGPT Pad V2.5:**

* [ ] **Referral System:** Get rewarded for inviting friends! Our referral system offers a percentage of every IDO your referrals join, creating incentives for community growth.
* [ ] **Automated Newsletter:** Stay in the loop with automated newsletters delivered via Email and Telegram. Receive updates on important events, upcoming IDOs, and more.

* [ ] **Bond Sale Page:** Introducing bonds to support projects across all stages, allowing our community to purchase tokens at a discount (typically 5%-20%) after the Token Generation Event (TGE). This feature helps us support projects not only in the seed stage and pre-listing stage but also post-TGE stage.
* [ ] **Streamlining Solana Integration:** Simplified user flow by eliminating the need to connect sub-wallets manually. Sub-wallets will now be generated automatically, reducing friction for users. Additionally, there will no longer be a requirement to connect both an EVM and a Solana walletâ€”users will only need to connect one wallet for seamless interaction across both ecosystems.
* [ ] **Integrated Vesting Portal in Pad:** A dedicated vesting portal will be integrated directly into Pad v3 to support KOLs, influencers, and external sales. This feature ensures efficient token distribution and vesting management for all private contributors outside of public IDOs, offering a streamlined experience for all stakeholders involved.
* [ ] SUI Network Integration
* [ ] TON Network
* [ ] CGPT Pass
* [ ] KOLs Protal & Sales Flow
* [ ] Questing Feature

* [ ] **Staking Points Marketplace:** Users can now rent their staking points to other users, and determine the amount of staking points they want to rent, for which duration of time, and for what price for that duration.
* [ ] **Automation:** Users can deposit USDT into our contract and set up automatic purchases for IDOs and FCFS rounds. This feature will be available under 'My Profile' as a separate tab, likely exclusive to Gold and Diamond, or only Diamond tier members. (DAO Vote Pending)
* [ ] **Research Page:** The Research Page will feature all upcoming projects hosting IDOs, irrespective of whether they are using ChainGPT Pad. Each project will be assigned a score based on various criteria such as security, team, code quality, and governance. The goal is to attract users to ChainGPT Pad to access and evaluate IDO project scores. There will be a single page listing all projects and dedicated pages for each project providing a detailed breakdown of scores and factors.
* [ ] **ROI Prediction with AI / Machine Learning:** We are developing a unique AI model to predict the ROI of projects based on various parameters. Initially, it will be used internally by the launchpad team for project filtering. Once its accuracy is verified, we plan to make it publicly available. This feature will likely be accessible to Diamond members and integrated into the research page, displaying ROI predictions alongside project scores.
* [ ] **Launch with ChainGPT Pad Page:** This page offers guidance on launching IDOs with ChainGPT Pad and highlights the benefits of partnering with us. It simplifies the application process for projects seeking to host an IDO with ChainGPT Pad, and provides our community with insights into how we support startups through this platform.
* [ ] **Narrative & Research Page:** This page displays top narratives, trending coins, volume statistics by category, BTC/Altcoin/Ethereum dominance, and other key factors to aid our investors. Information sourced from providers like Dune, CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, InTheBlock, and similar data sources will be fully automated.
* [ ] **AI Chatbot & Live Customer Service:** Accessible via a chat icon located in the bottom right or left corner of every page, offering options to interact with ChainGPT's AI Chatbot or live customer support for prompt assistance.
* [ ] **Auto Translator for Better SEO:** Implementing automatic translation of every page into multiple languages to enhance SEO rankings, and to ensure non-English speakers have better access to ChainGPT Pad.
* [ ] **Social Task Giveaway Campaigns:** Participate in built-in social task giveaway campaigns, akin to platforms such as Galxe and Gleam.
