# 2023: Q2

Status: Not Initiated

### 1st Quarter of 2023 Summary

In Q2 2023, we aim to enhance our engineering team and progress our ground-breaking AI-based blockchain technology. We are launching a testnet version of our layer-2 blockchain, optimized for AI smart-contracts and on-chain models. Along with the testnet, we will provide an explorer, a marketplace for AI models and tools, a web wallet, a wallet extension, wallet apps for IOS and Android, a custom Remix for smart-contract deployment, a wormhole (bridge), a decentralized exchange for ChainGPT tokens, and finally, the mainnet release of the ChainGPT blockchain.&#x20;

Additionally, we will develop AI-powered utilities using ChainGPT tech such as an AI NFT generator DApp and an AI trading bot DApp. We will also expand our team of software engineers and machine learning engineers. For a comprehensive overview of our goals and progress, please refer to the list below.
