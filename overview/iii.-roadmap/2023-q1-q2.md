# 2023: Q1-Q2

Status: **In Progress**

### 1st Quarter of 2023 Summary

Our primary goal for Q1â€“Q2 2023 will be to strengthen our AI model, the foundation of our technology and ecosystem, through our committed team's ongoing efforts to develop it. By granting third-party developers and companies access to our API & SDK, we are also enhancing the capabilities of our AI model and enabling them to create unique solutions tailored to their requirements. The beta and official versions of ChainGPT chatbot, DevAssist browser extension, Staking & Farming DApp, ChainGPT News, IOS & Android chatbot app, prompt marketplace, Telegram/Discord/Slack AI bot, and our utility token $CGPT are just a few of the cutting-edge AI tools and products we will be releasing in Q1-Q2.

The fuel that powers all of ChainGPT's goods and services, $CGPT, will play a significant part in our ecosystem. The $CGPT token will be accessible through a DEX/CEX launch, a public utility token sale, and private utility token sales. In addition, we want to grow our technical team and advance our revolutionary blockchain technology powered by AI. We will use ChainGPT technology to create AI-powered tools like a trading bot and an NFT generation DApp. Also, we'll grow our staff of software and machine learning engineers.
