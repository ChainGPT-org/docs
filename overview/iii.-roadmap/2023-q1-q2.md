# 2023: Q1-Q2

Status: **In Progress**

### 1st Quarter of 2023 Summary

Our focus in Q1-Q2 2023 is to further enhance our AI model, the backbone of our technology and ecosystem, through continuous improvement efforts by our dedicated team. We are also expanding the capabilities of our AI model by offering API & SDK access to third-party developers and businesses, enabling them to build custom solutions that meet their specific needs. In Q1-Q2, we will be launching a suite of cutting-edge AI tools and products, including the beta and official versions of ChainGPT chatbot, DevAssist browser extension, Staking & Farming DApp, ChainGPT News, IOS & Android chatbot app, prompt marketplace, Telegram/Discord/Slack AI bot, and our utility token $GPT.&#x20;

$GPT will play a key role in our ecosystem, acting as the fuel that drives all the products and services offered by ChainGPT. The $GPT token will be made available through private utility token sale, public utility token sale, and a DEX/CEX launch.&#x20;

We aim to enhance our engineering team and progress our ground-breaking AI-based blockchain technology.
