# Transformer Architecture

Transformer architecture refers to the specific design of a neural network that was uncovered and implemented by Google's AI team, Google Brain.

Superseding its predecessor architecture known as RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks); transformer architecture is an adaptive approach to the processing of data. Rather than sequencing steams of information in chronological strings, transformer architectures process entire blocks of data simultaneously and substitute form factors in order to optimize the coherence of data.

Rooted in the ability to identify core concepts by accurately allocating its focus, transformer architecture displaces excessive processing through the application of four components, Attention Mechanisms, Multi-head Attention, Feed-Forward Layers, and Normalization Layers.&#x20;

ChainGPT makes good use of the transformer architecture in the design of its AI by allowing users the ability to provide theoretically unlimited input requests and being able to aptly handle them.
