# Learn The Concepts

ChainGPT AI Model is your go-to AI tool for anything related to Crypto and Blockchain. From solidity development to smart contracts, pine script, and many other solutions, ChainGPT utilizes its advanced AI model. To understand how ChainGPT works, you'll need to be able to familiarize yourself with the concepts behind this technology. It doesn't matter if you're a developer, a business, or a crypto/blockchain enthusiast; understanding the mechanism and technology behind ChainGPT AI can help you learn how to interact with it and improve your workflow.&#x20;

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: ChainGPT is designed to understand and process any input and generate relevant answers using NLP algorithms.&#x20;

**Machine Learning**: ChainGPT is built on machine-learning open-source models that were improved significantly and trained to become the advanced AI model ChainGPT is today.

**Transformer Architecture**: ChainGPT utilizes transformer architecture, which is a deep learning model designed for sequential data processing such as text.

**Pretrained Language** **Model**:  ChainGPT was trained on a dataset created by our Machine Learning Engineers, and the model was trained on an extensive database of information regarding Blockchain Technologies, Crypto, Technical Analysis, Security Audits, and many more categories in this space. Which allowed us to create the high amount of functionalities we offer.

**Generative Model**:  As a generative AI model, ChainGPT can generate information in continuity to the input ("prompt") it receives. This way, it can answer any user questions regarding Blockchain or Crypto.&#x20;

**Fine-Tuning**: To further improve ChainGPT, fine-tuning is a crucial phase to remove inaccurate data and enhance the AI with more information and guidance.&#x20;

**Tokenization**: Tokenization is breaking down the text into smaller units, such as words or subwords, which the model can process.

**Contextual Awareness**: ChainGPT is equipped with contextual awareness, allowing it to understand the context of a conversation and generate relevant responses.
