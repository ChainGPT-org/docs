# Generative Model

The portion of AI technology that pertains to the output/result of processes.

Generative models replicate the human faculty of creativity by detecting patterns, correlations, and disjunctions in order to produce novel outputs/responses.

Currently the major use case of converting text-based inputs into text, visual, and audio outputs; generative models have found incredible applications across various fields of artistic outlets including short-form copywriting, long-form storytelling, website design, branding, and even oil canvas painting and software code.

ChainGPT synthesizes the best qualities in open-sourced models to derive its own unique generative capabilities for its chatbot conversations, smart contract creation, and NFT generation.
