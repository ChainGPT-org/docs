# Contextual Awareness

Contextual awareness is the ability to assimilate an accurate interpretation of information based on the “environment” within which it is presented.

Context imbues meaning into sentences and defines high-level human processing. The context can change the meanings of terms and give insight into the essence of any message's purpose.

As it relates to artificial intelligence, contextual awareness is the ability of an AI model to extrapolate information on a situational basis that considers more variables that are visibly present, a process called inference, where the machine infers information that is not directly expressed.&#x20;

ChainGPT maximally benefits from the high degree of contextual awareness baked into its AI model, allowing it to understand requests based on the nature of the request rather than just the words used.
