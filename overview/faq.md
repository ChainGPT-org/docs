## About $CGPT [Utility Token](https://docs.chaingpt.org/overview/iv.-cgpt-utility-token)

<details>

<summary>What is $CGPT token? </summary>

$CGPT, or ChainGPT Token, is the utility token powering the ChainGPT ecosystem. ChainGPT is a futuristic AI chatbot designed to assist individuals, developers, and businesses with anything related to Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrencies.&#x20;

**Some of the key features and use cases of the $CGPT token include:**

1\. Access to ChainGPT services: Token holders can use $CGPT to access various ChainGPT services such as AI-generated news, AI smart contract generator and auditor tools, AI NFT Generator, Launchpad, and more.

2\. Staking and Farming: Users can stake and farm their $CGPT tokens.

3\. Governance: $CGPT token holders have governance rights, allowing them to participate in voting on important decisions and proposals related to the development and future of ChainGPT.

4\. Discounts and exclusive features: Holding $CGPT tokens may grant users discounts on certain services within the ChainGPT ecosystem and access to exclusive features.

The total supply of CGPT is 1 billion (1,000,000,000) tokens. It is currently deployed on the BSC (Binance Smart Chain) network, with plans to expand to other networks like Ethereum, Polygon Matic, Avalanche, and more in the future.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I get $CGPT? </summary>

There are two ways to acquire $CGPT tokens: buying and earning. \
\
Buying: $CGPT is listed across a multitude of partnering exchanges (CEX and DEX); for a list of all tradeable markets, please check [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chaingpt/#Markets). \
\
Earning: ChainGPT is constantly hosting trading competitions with $CGPT incentives.

Please ensure you're using the correct smart contract address for CGPT when interacting with decentralized exchanges: 0x9840652DC04fb9db2C43853633f0F62BE6f00f98. Always double-check the contract address to avoid scams or fake tokens.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What blockchain network is $CGPT deployed on?</summary>

The $CGPT token is a BEP-20 standard token on the Binance smart chain. It has also been deployed on the Ethereum network as an ERC-20. As the project matures, the token will be bridged to other EVM-compatible chains.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is $CGPT's Supply Policy?</summary>

Fixed maximum supply with deflation via burn.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does $CGPT's Burn Mechanism work? </summary>

The $CGPT token incorporates a burn mechanism as a pivotal element of its economic policy, aiming to systematically reduce the circulating supply and induce scarcity. Here's how it operates within the ChainGPT ecosystem:

1. **Burning Process**: Tokens are permanently removed from the circulating supply by sending them to a non-spendable, void address on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) - `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`.
2. **Application**: Every commercial-grade transaction within ChainGPT has a burn component, ensuring that every user interaction directly contributes to the health and growth of the $CGPT ecosystem.
3. **Key Burn Touchpoints**:
   * **Prompt Marketplace**: All fees are subjected to a 100% burn, ensuring they are entirely removed from circulation.
   * **Chatbot & Tools**: 50% of the fees from the Chatbot and related AI tools are burned, with the other half allocated to the ChainGPT Foundation and DAO Treasury.
   * **AI NFT Generator (NFT Gen)**: 50% of the associated fees are burned, while the remainder is split between the ChainGPT Foundation and DAO Treasury.
   * **ChainGPT Pad**: For every Initial Dex Offering (IDO) hosted on the ChainGPT Pad, 1% of the raised amount is utilized to buy back $CGPT tokens from the market and burn them.
   * **Whitelabel Solutions**: When other companies or projects purchase whitelabel solutions or licenses from ChainGPT, 10% of the total transaction value is used for a $CGPT market buy-back and burn.
   * **ChainGPT NFT Collection Sales**: For direct NFT sales by ChainGPT, 20% of the proceeds go towards buying back and burning $CGPT tokens.
4. **Token Allocation**: Any $CGPT tokens reverted to ChainGPT or the DAO are evenly distributed between them. These funds are reinvested in development, marketing, community engagement, and other initiatives to further ChainGPT's growth.
5. **Impact Thesis**: The deliberate reduction of circulating tokens amplifies scarcity, boosting market velocity and potentially positively influencing the token's valuation.

<details>

<summary>Can I use ChainGPT without spending $CGPT?</summary>

Yes, ChainGPT offers multiple ways to access its utilities without directly spending $CGPT. You can leverage the "Freemium" model by staking CGPT, which provides enhanced AI access at no additional cost. Alternatively, if you prefer not to stake, ChainGPT provides a "Pay-Per-Usage" option, or you can explore a range of AI tools available on the platform for free.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is the $CGPT Contract audited?</summary>

Yes, $CGPT has dual audits from [Certik](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/chaingpt) and [Hacken](https://hacken.io/audits/chaingpt/).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is there a $CGPT bug bounty program?</summary>

Yes. You can find it [here](https://docs.chaingpt.org/developer-docs/bug-bounty-program) and on the [Certik Website](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/chaingpt?utm\_source=CMC\&utm\_campaign=AuditByCertiKLink).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I stake $CGPT?</summary>

Yes. The Staking dashboard is available[ ](https://staking.chaingpt.org/)[here](https://staking.chaingpt.org/).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why stake $CGPT?</summary>

Staking serves four crucial functions within the ChainGPT Ecosystem. Firstly, it offers individuals free and unlimited access to ChainGPT without spending their $CGPT tokens with each request. Second, in order for businesses and developers to build commercial products with the ChainGPT API, they must commit to a pool of $CGPT tokens, which will serve as the reservoir of purchasing power for their API requests. Third, $CGPT staking provides access to the ChainGPT DAO. Fourth, $CGPT staking is necessary to accumulate tier points to access the ChaingGPT Pad.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Does ChainGPT have a prompt base?</summary>

Our prompt marketplace will be made available after the v1.0 release. Access can be found on the application [dashboard](https://app.chaingpt.org/).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do I have to pay the network fees in order to interact with ChainGPT?</summary>

General interactions such as single generations are free and do not require any fees.

Interactions such as minting NFT's, staking, trading, etc. will require the appropriate gas fees to interact on chain.

Please note, users with 200,000 staking points (CGPTsp) will receive diamond tier, in turn giving them Freemium access to our products. This will not cover on-chain network fees as these are not within our control. Learn more about Freemium [here](https://www.chaingpt.org/pricing).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Where does ChainGPT source news?</summary>
