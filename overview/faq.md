## About $CGPT [Utility Token](https://docs.chaingpt.org/overview/iv.-cgpt-utility-token)

<details>

<summary><strong>What is $CGPT token?</strong> </summary>

$CGPT, or ChainGPT Token, is the utility token powering the ChainGPT ecosystem. ChainGPT is a futuristic AI chatbot designed to assist individuals, developers, and businesses with anything related to Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrencies.&#x20;

**Some of the key features and use cases of the $CGPT token include:**

1\. Access to ChainGPT services: Token holders can use $CGPT to access various ChainGPT services such as AI-generated news, AI smart contract generator and auditor tools, AI NFT Generator, Launchpad, and more.

2\. Staking and Farming: Users can stake and farm their $CGPT tokens.

3\. Governance: $CGPT token holders have governance rights, allowing them to participate in voting on important decisions and proposals related to the development and future of ChainGPT.

4\. Discounts and exclusive features: Holding $CGPT tokens may grant users discounts on certain services within the ChainGPT ecosystem and access to exclusive features.

The total supply of CGPT is 1 billion (1,000,000,000) tokens. It is currently deployed on the BSC (Binance Smart Chain) network, with plans to expand to other networks like Ethereum, Polygon Matic, Avalanche, and more in the future.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>How can I get $CGPT?</strong> </summary>

There are two ways to acquire $CGPT tokens: buying and earning. \
\
Buying: $CGPT is listed across a multitude of partnering exchanges (CEX and DEX); for a list of all tradeable markets, please check [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chaingpt/#Markets). \
\
Earning: ChainGPT is constantly hosting trading competitions with $CGPT incentives.

Please ensure you're using the correct smart contract address for CGPT when interacting with decentralized exchanges: 0x9840652DC04fb9db2C43853633f0F62BE6f00f98. Always double-check the contract address to avoid scams or fake tokens.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What blockchain network is $CGPT deployed on?</strong></summary>

The $CGPT token is a BEP-20 standard token on the Binance smart chain. It has also been deployed on the Ethereum network as an ERC-20. As the project matures, the token will be bridged to other EVM-compatible chains.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What is $CGPT's Supply Policy?</strong></summary>

Fixed maximum supply with deflation via burn.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does $CGPT's Burn Mechanism work? </summary>

The $CGPT token incorporates a burn mechanism as a pivotal element of its economic policy, aiming to systematically reduce the circulating supply and induce scarcity. Here's how it operates within the ChainGPT ecosystem:

1. **Burning Process**: Tokens are permanently removed from the circulating supply by sending them to a non-spendable, void address on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) - `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`.
2. **Application**: Every commercial-grade transaction within ChainGPT has a burn component, ensuring that every user interaction directly contributes to the health and growth of the $CGPT ecosystem.
3. **Key Burn Touchpoints**:
   * **Prompt Marketplace**: All fees are subjected to a 100% burn, ensuring they are entirely removed from circulation.
   * **Chatbot & Tools**: 50% of the fees from the Chatbot and related AI tools are burned, with the other half allocated to the ChainGPT Foundation and DAO Treasury.
   * **AI NFT Generator (NFT Gen)**: 50% of the associated fees are burned, while the remainder is split between the ChainGPT Foundation and DAO Treasury.
   * **ChainGPT Pad**: For every Initial Dex Offering (IDO) hosted on the ChainGPT Pad, 1% of the raised amount is utilized to buy back $CGPT tokens from the market and burn them.
   * **Whitelabel Solutions**: When other companies or projects purchase whitelabel solutions or licenses from ChainGPT, 10% of the total transaction value is used for a $CGPT market buy-back and burn.
   * **ChainGPT NFT Collection Sales**: For direct NFT sales by ChainGPT, 20% of the proceeds go towards buying back and burning $CGPT tokens.
4. **Token Allocation**: Any $CGPT tokens reverted to ChainGPT or the DAO are evenly distributed between them. These funds are reinvested in development, marketing, community engagement, and other initiatives to further ChainGPT's growth.
5. **Impact Thesis**: The deliberate reduction of circulating tokens amplifies scarcity, boosting market velocity and potentially positively influencing the token's valuation.

Staking serves four crucial functions within the ChainGPT Ecosystem. Firstly, it offers individuals free and unlimited access to ChainGPT without spending their $CGPT tokens with each request.
