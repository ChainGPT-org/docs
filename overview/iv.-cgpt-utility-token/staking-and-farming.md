# Staking & Farming

## ChainGPT Staking & Farming: An Overview

The ChainGPT ecosystem offers multiple staking and farming options for $CGPT token holders, with staking mainly used to access the AI model, and farming used to earn rewards in $CGPT tokens.



### Staking: What It Is and How It Works

Staking is a mechanism that allows token holders to earn rewards or certain benefits within an ecosystem by locking up their tokens and contributing to the security and stability of the network. In the case of ChainGPT, staking enables token holders to access the AI model and receive priority access to its services. To participate in staking, a token holder must lock up a certain number of $CGPT tokens for a set period of time. This period can vary depending on the specific staking program. During this time, the tokens are not available for use, but the token holder enjoys the benefits that each staking program offers.



### Farming: What It Is and How It Works

Farming is a mechanism that allows token holders to earn rewards by providing liquidity to the ecosystem. In the case of ChainGPT, token holders can provide liquidity to the $CGPT token on decentralized exchanges, and earn rewards in the form of $CGPT tokens. To participate in farming, a token holder must deposit a certain number of $CGPT tokens into a liquidity pool on supported exchanges & pairs. This pool is then used to ensure the stability and liquidity of the token, and token holders earn rewards in the form of $CGPT tokens based on the amount of tokens they have deposited. The rewards earned through farming are proportional to the amount of tokens that a token holder has deposited and the length of time that they have been in the liquidity pool.



### Conclusion

ChainGPT's staking and farming mechanisms offer token holders the opportunity to earn rewards while supporting the stability and security of the network. Whether staking for access to the AI model or farming for rewards, token holders can take advantage of these opportunities to grow their $CGPT holdings and contribute to the ecosystem's growth.
