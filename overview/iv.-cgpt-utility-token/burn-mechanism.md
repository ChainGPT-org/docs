# Burn Mechanism

The ChainGPT ecosystem features a unique burn mechanism that plays an important role in the the platform's native token, $CGPT. This mechanism operates by automatically burning half of each fee or profit made by the ChainGPT tools & utilities. Thus reducing the overall supply of $CGPT and increasing its scarcity. For example, when a user pays 5 $CGPT for each request of ChainGPT AI, half of that is burnt out of the supply.&#x20;

## How does the burn apply in ChainGPT?

The burn mechanism applies to all transaction income within the ChainGPT ecosystem, including fees paid for AI access, as well as other income generated by the platform's various tools and utilities. This means that every time someone uses the ChainGPT AI, they are contributing to the platform's growth, as well as decreasing the $CGPT in the circulating supply.

The remaining half of the transaction income is used for the growth and sustainability of the ChainGPT platform. This includes funding for development, marketing, and other initiatives aimed at driving growth and improving the platform.&#x20;
