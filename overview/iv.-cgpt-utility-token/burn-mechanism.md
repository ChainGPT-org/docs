# Burn Mechanism

The ChainGPT ecosystem features a unique burn mechanism that plays an important role in increasing the value of the platform's native token, $GPT. This mechanism operates by automatically burning half of each fee or profit made by the ChainGPT tools & utilities. Thus reducing the overall supply of $GPT and increasing its scarcity. For example, when a user pays 5 $GPT for each request of ChainGPT AI, half of that is burnt out of the supply.&#x20;

### Purpose of the burn mechanism

The purpose of the burn mechanism is to increase the demand for $GPT, which in turn drives up its value. This is achieved by reducing the available supply of $GPT, which creates scarcity and makes the token more valuable. This makes it an attractive investment opportunity for those looking to get involved in the crypto and blockchain space.

## How does the burn apply in ChainGPT?

The burn mechanism applies to all transaction income within the ChainGPT ecosystem, including fees paid for AI access, as well as other income generated by the platform's various tools and utilities. This means that every time someone uses the ChainGPT AI, they are contributing to the platform's growth, as well as increasing the value of their own $GPT holdings.

The remaining half of the transaction income is used for the growth and sustainability of the ChainGPT platform. This includes funding for development, marketing, and other initiatives aimed at driving growth and improving the platform. This ensures that the platform remains viable and continues to grow, further increasing the value of $GPT for token holders.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the ChainGPT burn mechanism is a unique and powerful feature that drives up the value of $GPT by reducing its available supply. This mechanism incentivizes the use of the platform's AI tools and utilities, and provides a valuable investment opportunity for those looking to get involved in the crypto and blockchain space.
