# Burn Mechanism

The ChainGPT ecosystem features a unique burn mechanism that is vital to the platform's native token, $CGPT. This mechanism automatically burns half of each fee or profit the ChainGPT tools & utilities make. Thus reducing the overall supply of $CGPT and increasing its scarcity. For example, when a user pays 5 $CGPT for each request of ChainGPT AI, half of that is burnt out of the supply.&#x20;

## How does the burn apply in ChainGPT?

The burning mechanism applies to all transaction income within the ChainGPT ecosystem, including fees for AI access and other revenue generated by the platform's various tools and utilities. Every time someone uses the ChainGPT AI, they contribute to the platform's growth and decrease the $CGPT in the circulating supply.

The remaining half of the transaction income is used for the growth and sustainability of the ChainGPT platform. This includes funding for development, marketing, and other initiatives to drive growth and improve the platform.&#x20;
