#### **Welcome to ChainGPT's airdrop campaign in partnership with Seedify!**&#x20;

As we prepare for our IDO launch on April 7th, we want to celebrate by giving away a total of $5,000 worth of CGPT and SFUND tokens to our community.

To participate, all you need to do is complete a series of tasks that will qualify you for a chance to win. The more actions you complete, the greater your chances of being selected as one of the 100 winners who will each receive $25 worth of CGPT and $25 worth of SFUND.

To get started, head over to Seedify's website at [https://launchpad.seedify.fund/](https://launchpad.seedify.fund/) and follow the instructions provided. You can also visit ChainGPT's website at [https://www.chaingpt.org/](https://www.chaingpt.org/) to learn more about our AI model and its capabilities in the blockchain and crypto space.

We're thrilled to partner with Seedify for our IDO launch and to offer this airdrop campaign to our community. Don't miss out on this opportunity to unleash the power of blockchain AI with ChainGPT and Seedify. Good luck!
