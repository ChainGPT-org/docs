# ChainGPT Ecosystem

This page is a concept list of the features in the ChainGPT ecosystem. ChainGPT is an advanced AI model designed to support crypto & blockchain needs. It is accessible via the use of the ChainGPT Token ($CGPT), which is the utility token backing the ecosystem. To further incentivize usage and engagement, the team offers various staking & farming options for $CGPT holders and a unique burn mechanism that increases the token's value. Additionally, the team provides various AI-powered tools and utilities, including a browser extension, news generation, NFT generation, and a trading bot. Using these utilities results in fees, with 50% of the income being returned to $CGPT holders through the burn mechanism.

### ChainGPT Burn Mechanism

Half of each fee/profit made by ChainGPT's tools & utilities within the ecosystem are burnt out of the supply, increasing the value of $CGPT for holders. This includes the $CGPT spent on AI access and other income the ecosystem generates. The remaining half is used for the growth and sustainability of ChainGPT.
