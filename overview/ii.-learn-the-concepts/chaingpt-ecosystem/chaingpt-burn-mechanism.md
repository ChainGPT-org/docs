# ChainGPT Burn Mechanism

The ChainGPT ecosystem features a unique burn mechanism vital in increasing the value of the platform's native token, $CGPT. This mechanism automatically burns half of each fee or profit the ChainGPT tools & utilities make. Thus reducing the overall supply of $CGPT. For example, when a user pays 5 $CGPT for each request of ChainGPT AI, half of that is burnt out of the supply.&#x20;

### Which transactions does the burn apply to?

The burning mechanism applies to all transaction income within the ChainGPT ecosystem, including fees for AI access and other revenue generated by the platform's various tools and utilities. As a result, whenever someone uses the ChainGPT AI, they contribute to the platform's growth and increase the value of their own $CGPT holdings.

The remaining half of the transaction income is used for the growth and sustainability of the ChainGPT platform. This includes funding for development, marketing, and other initiatives to drive growth and improve the platform. This ensures that the platform remains viable and continues to grow, increasing the value of $CGPT for token holders.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the ChainGPT burn mechanism is a unique and powerful feature that drives up the value of $CGPT by reducing its available supply. In addition, this mechanism incentivizes using the platform's AI tools and utilities and provides a valuable investment opportunity for those looking to get involved in the crypto and blockchain space.
