# ChainGPT Burn Mechanism

The ChainGPT ecosystem features a unique burn mechanism that plays an important role in increasing the value of the platform's native token, $CGPT. This mechanism operates by automatically burning half of each fee or profit made by the ChainGPT tools & utilities. Thus reducing the overall supply of $CGPT. For example, when a user pays 5 $CGPT for each request of ChainGPT AI, half of that is burnt out of the supply.&#x20;

### Which transactions does the burn apply to?

The burn mechanism applies to all transaction income within the ChainGPT ecosystem, including fees paid for AI access, as well as other income generated by the platform's various tools and utilities. This means that every time someone uses the ChainGPT AI, they are contributing to the platform's growth, as well as increasing the value of their own $CGPT holdings.

The remaining half of the transaction income is used for the growth and sustainability of the ChainGPT platform. This includes funding for development, marketing, and other initiatives aimed at driving growth and improving the platform. This ensures that the platform remains viable and continues to grow, further increasing the value of $CGPT for token holders.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the ChainGPT burn mechanism is a unique and powerful feature that drives up the value of $CGPT by reducing its available supply. This mechanism incentivizes the use of the platform's AI tools and utilities, and provides a valuable investment opportunity for those looking to get involved in the crypto and blockchain space.
