**Pretrained Language** **Model**:  ChainGPT was pretrained on a dataset created by our Machine Learning Engineers, and the model was trained on a large database of information regarding Blockchain Technologies, Crypto, Technical Analysis, Security Audits, and many more categories in this space. Which allowed us to create the high amount of functionalities we offer.
