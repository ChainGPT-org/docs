# AI Inference Engine

On-chain AI inference is made possible by the ChainGPT platform's crucial AI Inference Engine. The Synapse engine is intended to produce predictable outcomes across diverse computing environments, serving as a solid foundation for the development of DApps and smart contracts that are improved by AI.



### Why is the AI Inference Engine Important?

#### The AI Inference Engine is important for several reasons:

1. Deterministic Results: The deterministic nature of the engine guarantees that the AI inference results will be consistent and accurate, providing a foundation for the creation of reliable AI-enhanced smart contracts and DApps.
2. Enhanced Performance: The engine utilizes the GPU instead of the CPU to execute AI models, enhancing the performance and scalability of the platform. This makes the ChainGPT platform an ideal solution for organizations looking to harness the power of AI and blockchain technology.
3. No Need for Off-Chain Solutions: The deterministic nature of the engine eliminates the need for off-chain solutions, as developers can rely on consistent and accurate results without having to resort to additional infrastructure.



### Conclusion

The AI Inference Engine is a critical component of the ChainGPT platform that enables on-chain AI inference and delivers deterministic results. The engine provides a foundation for the creation of reliable AI-enhanced smart contracts and DApps, and eliminates the need for off-chain solutions.  It doesn't matter if you're a developer, a business, an organization, or just a Crypto enthusiast. ChainGPT's AI technology is the go to option for you to improve your workflow in this space.
