# AI Smart Contract and AI DApp

ChainGPT is a cutting-edge platform that allows developers to create AI-enhanced decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. The platform's support for machine learning models, combined with the popularity of the Solidity programming language, makes it possible to build innovative solutions that can adapt to real-world use cases.

In this documentation page, we will delve deeper into the AI Smart Contract and AI DApp features of the ChainGPT platform.



### AI-Enabled Smart Contracts

A smart contract is a self-executing computer program that can automate the enforcement, management, and execution of agreements. With the support for AI in ChainGPT, smart contracts can now be enhanced with the ability to process and analyze data, make decisions, and trigger events based on the results of AI models.

This opens up a world of new possibilities for developers. For example, AI-enabled smart contracts can be used to automate complex financial instruments, manage supply chain processes, or implement predictive maintenance solutions.



### Using Solidity and Access to AI Models

ChainGPT supports the popular Solidity programming language, which is widely used for creating Ethereum-based DApps and smart contracts. This makes it easy for developers to get started with the platform, as they can leverage their existing knowledge and experience with the language.

In addition to the programming language, ChainGPT also provides access to a wide range of off-the-shelf AI models stored on its storage layer. These models can be used to add machine learning capabilities to smart contracts and DApps. This eliminates the need for developers to build and train their own models, which can be a complex and time-consuming task.



### AI-Enabled DApps

A decentralized application, or DApp, is a software application that runs on a decentralized network. With the support for AI in ChainGPT, developers can create DApps that incorporate machine learning capabilities.

For example, an AI-enabled DApp could use machine learning algorithms to analyze data and make predictions, automate decision-making processes, or implement chatbots that can respond to user requests.



### Conclusion

The AI Smart Contract and AI DApp features of the ChainGPT platform make it possible for developers to create innovative solutions that leverage the power of AI and blockchain technology. With the support for Solidity and access to off-the-shelf AI models, developers can build cutting-edge applications that can deliver significant value to users.
