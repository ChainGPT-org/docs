# AI Smart Contract and AI DApp

Decentralized apps (DApps) and smart contracts can be built with the help of the cutting-edge ChainGPT platform. Building creative solutions that are adaptable to real-world use situations is made possible by the platform's support for machine learning models and the popularity of the Solidity programming language. On this documentation page, we will explore deeper into the AI Smart Contract and AI DApp aspects of the ChainGPT platform.



### AI-Enabled Smart Contracts

A self-executing computer software known as a "smart contract" can automate the management, execution, and enforcement of contracts. With the support for AI in ChainGPT, smart contracts can now be enhanced with the ability to process and analyze data, make decisions, and trigger events based on the results of AI models.

This opens up an unlimited amount of new possibilities for developers. For example, AI-enabled smart contracts can automate complex financial instruments, manage supply chain processes, or implement predictive maintenance solutions.



### Using Solidity and Access to AI Models

ChainGPT supports the popular Solidity programming language, widely used for creating Ethereum-based DApps and smart contracts. This approach makes it easier for developers to develop on top of the ChainGPT Blockchain with a programming language they already know (Solidity).

In addition to the programming language, ChainGPT provides access to a wide range of off-the-shelf AI models stored on its storage layer. These models can add machine learning capabilities to smart contracts and DApps. This eliminates the need for developers to build and train their models, which can be complex and time-consuming.



### AI-Enabled DApps

A decentralized application, or DApp, is a software application that runs on a decentralized network. With the support for AI in ChainGPT, developers can create DApps that incorporate machine learning capabilities.

For example, an AI-enabled DApp could use machine learning algorithms to analyze data and make predictions, automate decision-making processes, or implement chatbots that can respond to user requests.



### Conclusion

The AI Smart Contract and AI DApp features of the ChainGPT platform make it possible for developers to create innovative solutions that leverage the power of AI and blockchain technology. With the support for Solidity and access to off-the-shelf AI models, developers can build cutting-edge applications that deliver significant user value.
