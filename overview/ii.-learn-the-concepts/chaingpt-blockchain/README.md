# ChainGPT Blockchain

The Blockchain Tech space is evolving fast, and so does Artificial Intelligence. There is a significant need for an advanced Blockchain that efficiently allows an on-chain AI model. We can create the most advanced AI Blockchain by implementing the latest resources and research. The advent of ChainGPT, the next-generation virtual machine, offers a unique combination of EVM compatibility and on-chain AI inference.

The CGVM is EVM-compatible, which means it is built to be backward-compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. However, it also supports on-chain AI inference, which allows it to execute complex AI models using the GPU instead of the CPU.&#x20;



### AI Inference Engine

The deterministic AI inference engine, Synapse, is the backbone of the ChainGPT platform. It guarantees that the AI inference results are identical across heterogenetic computing environments. This means developers can rely on consistent and accurate results, eliminating the need for off-chain solutions.



### AI Smart Contract and AI DApp

ChainGPT aims to create an open-source environment where AI developers and academics are encouraged to disseminate their models to a global audience. This will make it simpler for developers or businesses to access advanced AI models specifically for Blockchain and Crypto.



### Conclusion

The ChainGPT virtual machine offers a unique combination of EVM compatibility and on-chain AI inference, making it an ideal solution for organizations looking to harness the power of AI and blockchain technology. In addition, the deterministic AI inference engine and the support for AI-enhanced smart contracts and DApps make it an attractive platform for developers and researchers. By fostering an open-source ecosystem for AI research, ChainGPT has the potential to drive innovation and collaboration in AI.
