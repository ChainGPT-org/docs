1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: By utilizing NLP algorithms, ChainGPT is designed to understand and process any input and generate relevant answers.&#x20;
2. **Machine Learning**: ChainGPT is built on machine-learning open-source models that were then improved sagnificantlly and trained to become the advanced AI model ChainGPT is today.
3. **Transformer Architecture**: ChainGPT utilizes the transformer architecture, which is a deep learning model designed for sequential data processing such as text.
4. **Pretrained Language** Model: ChainGPT was pretrained on a dataset created by our Machine Learning Engineers, and the model was trained on a large database of information regarding Blockchain Technologies, Crypto, Technical Analysis, Security Audits, and many more categories in this space. Which allowed us to create the high amount of functionalities we offer.
5. **Generative Model**: As a generative AI model, ChainGPT is capable of generating information in continuitie to the input ("prompt") that it receieves. This way, it can answer any questions regarding Blockchain or Crypto that a user may ask.&#x20;
6. **Fine-Tuning**: In order to further improve ChainGPT, fine-tuning is an important phase to remove any inaccurate data, and improve the AI with more information and guidance.&#x20;
7. **Tokenization**: Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units, such as words or subwords, which can be processed by the model.
8. **Contextual Awareness**: ChainGPT is equipped with contextual awareness, allowing it to understand the context of a conversation and generate relevant responses.
