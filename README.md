## Introduction to ChainGPT

Unleash the **power** of **Blockchain** AI with ChainGPT. An advanced AI model explicitly designed for Blockchain Technology and Crypto-related topics. It uses the latest algorithms and high-speed computing capabilities to address challenging issues in the Blockchain and Crypto space. Using ChainGPT, users may quickly obtain whatever knowledge and information they require. With many other unique features designed for individuals, developers, and businesses, ChainGPT is an essential tool for all in the Blockchain space.

Among its unique features: Blockchain & Crypto information, no-code smart contract generator, smart-contract auditor, code debugger, code-to-words, documentation creator, chart analysis & technical analysis, AML features, Blockchain analytics, on-chain live data, source of news, and much more. By creating the most advanced AI model, we offer users unlimited use cases to which ChainGPT can be applied. Furthermore, our SDK & API service makes it possible to develop new applications powered by ChainGPT or integrate them into existing ones.&#x20;

ChainGPT is backed by the CGPT utility token, which is required to access various AI tools and products powered by ChainGPT. So it's playing a significant role in the ecosystem of ChainGPT.



### Here's a Quick Overview of What ChainGPT Has To Offer:

* **AI Chatbot**: The ChainGPT AI Chatbot is a conversational AI-powered assistant that was designed specifically for Blockchain technology and crypto. Whether you're an individual, developer, or business, ChainGPT can assist you with a wide range of tasks: no-code smart-contract programming, debugging, market analysis, guidance, trading, and more. The beta version is currently live, and It's free; check it out: [https://app.chaingpt.org](https://app.chaingpt.org).
* **Dev Assist**: Dev Assist is an open-source browser extension that provides users a comprehensive understanding of smart-contract interactions. The tool visually represents the code and its workings, making it easier for developers and non-developers alike to understand how the contracts work.

* **AI Trading Bot:** The AI Trading Bot is an AI-powered trading bot that will automatically analyze market data and make trading decisions on behalf of the user (limited to decentralized exchanges). It is designed to maximize profits while minimizing risks and can execute trades in a fraction of a second.
* **ChainGPT (Layer-1 Blockchain) Virtual Machine**: The ChainGPT Virtual Machine is a next-generation virtual machine that offers a unique combination of EVM compatibility and on-chain AI inference. It is designed to enable the development of decentralized AI applications on the blockchain.

Half of all the fees and profits collected by the ChainGPT tools & utilities within the ecosystem are burned, decreasing the supply of $CGPT. The other half is used for the growth and sustainability of the ChainGPT ecosystem.

ChainGPT is also actively developing other innovative tools and utilities that will enable users to take advantage of the potential of blockchain-based AI. From on-chain AI inference and AI-generated NFTs to AI trading bots and decentralized AI application development, ChainGPT is at the forefront of the blockchain-AI revolution.
