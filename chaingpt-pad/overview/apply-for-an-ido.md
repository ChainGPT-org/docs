Users that wish to participate in the IDOs that the ChainGPT launchpad offers must satisfy two criteria:

_**1)**_ They must complete onboarding with our KYC/AML partner Blockpass\
ðŸ‘‰ [_**KYC Here**_ ](http://url.chaingpt.org/kyc)ðŸ‘ˆ

_**2)**_ They must stake enough $CGPT to accumulate enough points and attain at least Bronze tier status ðŸ¥© [_**Stake Here**_](https://staking.chaingpt.org/) ðŸ¥©

Once a user has become qualified, they will unlock priority participation rights for every upcoming IDO.

_In order to confirm their desire to partake in any given IDO, users will have to register their intent to participate. The ability to register an intention is available to users for up to 24 hours **before** the IDO launch._
