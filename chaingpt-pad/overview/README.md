## Pad Introduction

ChainGPT empowers crypto, blockchain, and Web3 startups with AI infrastructure, enabling efficient automation and rapid scalability. The ChainGPT Launchpad connects the $CGPT community with promising startups, providing priority participation benefits and opportunities. It serves as an IDO platform and incubator, supporting Web3 projects to implement their ideas and bootstrap their token ecosystems.

**How it works**

When projects apply to the ChainGPT launchpad, they are subjected to a thorough qualitative analysis process conducted by the ChainGPT team. The selection of projects for the incubation/acceleration phase is based on various assessment criteria, including product market fit, concept viability, and team aptitude. Once chosen, these projects enter the incubation/acceleration phase and benefit from the guidance provided by the ChainGPT Mentorship group. Following this phase, a coming-to-market process takes place through IDO.

Typically lasting 12-18 months, the incubation phase consists of three stages: preparation, launch, and post-launch support. During the preparation stage, the mentor group assists projects in organizing internal processes, optimizing product systems, and evaluating roadmaps and action plans. In the launch stage, they provide support with promotions and social coordination. ChainGPT continues to offer advisory support after the launch to help projects address challenges and make necessary adjustments for their products in the market.

For well-developed teams that require focused and limited support, there is an accelerated program known as acceleration, which lasts for 3-4 months.

**How the IDO works**

When projects are prepared to list on the platform and launch their token ecosystems, ChainGPT assists them in creating a campaign and connecting with the $CGPT community. Once the project's specifications, including token supply, market rate, and sale duration, are finalized, a countdown is initiated for the listing.

The IDO process consists of three rounds:

* Round #1 (Guaranteed Allocation) This round is reserved for top staking tier groups, namely Silver, Gold, and Diamond Tier.
* Round #2 (FCFS) In this round, allocations are offered on a first-come, first-serve basis to participants across all tiers.
* Round #3 (FCFS+) This round extends the first-come, first-serve allocation to include participants from all tiers, as well as Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs), Venture Capital (VC) Partners, and KYC'ed members.

Note: If a project reaches its maximum IDO capacity at any point, the IDO process will immediately halt, and no further rounds will be conducted.

**How $CGPT fits in**

$CGPT serves as the tool that facilitates community engagement in supporting projects, acting as an additional layer of a reward system to incentivize membership. By staking the required threshold amounts of $CGPT tokens, community members gain priority access to IDO participation, airdrops, and other exclusive benefits offered by startup projects to their earliest contributors.
