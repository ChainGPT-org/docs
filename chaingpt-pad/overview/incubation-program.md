# Incubation Program

## Objective

The objective of the Incubator Program is to bridge knowledge gaps, accelerate development, minimize errors, and shorten the learning curve for launching successful Web3 companies.

The Incubator Program welcomes projects at various stages of their lifecycles, including early stage MVPs, proof-of-concepts, projects in their go-to-market phase, and beyond. The aim is to establish long-lasting relationships.
