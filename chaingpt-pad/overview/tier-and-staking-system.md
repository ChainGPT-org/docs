# Tier & Staking System

## Staking & Points System

The qualification process for becoming a member of the Launchpad is determined by a simple point-based staking system. Two factors are taken into account when calculating points: the number of tokens staked and the duration of tokens staked. These two factors together determine the tier category, which can be Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Diamond.

Each $CGPT token staked is equivalent to one point.

Additionally, the duration of the stake in different pools carries its own point multiplier:

* 45 days (1% APY) = 1x points multiplier
* 90 days (3% APY) = 1.3x points multiplier
* 180 days (5% APY) = 1.5x points multiplier
* 365 days (8% APY) = 2x points multiplier

## Tier System

There are four different tier levels in the ChainGPT Launchpad and each tier has its own distinct benefits:

### **ðŸ¥‰ Bronze ðŸ¥‰**

This is the entry-level tier designed specifically for users that have limited capital capacities.

* **Points Required:** >2,000+
* **Pool Weight:** 1x Allocation Multiplier
* **Refund Eligibility:** Yes, 100%
* **Participation rounds:** #2, and #3 (FCFS and FCFS+)

Participation in the _first round_ is _not guaranteed_ to all Bronze tier members. Select, limited groups of Bronze users that complete social tasks will be given access to participation in the first round of allocation. Social campaigns will be initiated through gleam.io and provide whitelisted opportunities to participants.
