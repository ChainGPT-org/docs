## Governance Introduction

The ChainGPT Governance system offers community members and stakers of the $CGPT token the option to make a difference within the ecosystem. Members of the DAO can create and vote over proposals, choose how to spend the DAO fund, and decide on the future development of the ecosystem.

**How to become a DAO Member:**

* Obtain $CGPT tokens ([list of exchanges](https://chaingpt.org/#buy))
* Stake $CGPT for voting power on [staking.chaingpt.org](https://staking.chaingpt.org)
* Join the ChainGPT DAO on [dao.chaingpt.org](https://dao.chaingpt.org)&#x20;

### ChainGPT DAO Fund Explained

The ChainGPT DAO has a special fund for the community and the DAO itself. This fund contains 9% of the total token supply. Right now, the fund is locked, but starting October 10th, 2023, 90 million $CGPT tokens will gradually become available over 4.5 years. This unlocking process follows a schedule: 0% at the Token Generation Event (TGE), a 6-month waiting period, and then 54 months of vesting.

DAO members can decide how to use these tokens by creating and voting on proposals. This process is decentralized, allowing for various uses like setting up a new staking pool, moving tokens to a different EVM chain, or giving airdrops to stakers. The DAO fund empowers the community to make more decisions together.

### Voting Power

To gain voting power within the ChainGPT ecosystem, users are required to stake $CGPT tokens in any of the available staking pools. The longer users stake $CGPT the more voting power they get per $CGPT token.

* 15-day pool = 1x voting power per CGPT
* 45-day pool = 2x voting power per CGPT
* 185-day pool = 5x voting power per CGPT
* 365-day pool = 10x voting power per CGPT

Note: Farming pools (such as CGPT/BUSD) do not provide any voting power at this time.&#x20;

### Proposal Process

When a proposal is made, there's a 12-hour waiting period before DAO members can start voting. Members then have 3 days to cast their votes on the proposal. The option with the most votes wins and will be implemented.

### Create a Proposal

DAO members possessing a minimum of 30,000 voting power have the ability to create proposals. To initiate this process, follow these steps:

1. Visit the proposal creation page: [https://dao.chaingpt.org/#/create](https://dao.chaingpt.org/#/create)
2. Choose an informative title and a concise description that clearly communicates your proposal's objectives and desired outcomes.
3. Offer multiple options for DAO members to consider, ensuring a comprehensive approach to decision-making.
4. Once you have finalized the proposal, deploy it on-chain.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: When a proposal is created, a snapshot is taken of all CGPT stakers and their voting power at that moment. If someone stakes more tokens later, it won't change their voting power for proposals that already exist, even if those proposals are still live.

### The Future Aim of Our DAO

We want to continually make the ChainGPT DAO better with the support of our community. Our plan is to perfect the system and then give control of the $CGPT token to the DAO contract. After that, we'll let go of the DAO contract's ownership. This means decisions will be made democratically by all $CGPT stakers, including the team. We can still make changes at this point, but we'll need to create proposals and get most of the community to agree.

### In Conclusion

The ChainGPT DAO governance system is a critical component of the platform, as it enables community members to make important decisions that impact the platform's future growth and development. The voting power system is designed to ensure that the voices of long-term supporters and community members are heard and given greater weight in the decision-making process.
