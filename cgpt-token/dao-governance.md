## Governance Introduction

The ChainGPT Governance system offers community members and stakers of the $CGPT token the option to make a difference within the ecosystem. Members of the DAO can create and vote over proposals, choose how to spend the DAO fund and decide on the future development of the ecosystem.

**How to become a DAO Member:**

* Obtain CGPT tokens ([list of exchanges](https://chaingpt.org/#buy))
* Stake $CGPT for voting power on [staking.chaingpt.org](https://staking.chaingpt.org)
* Join the ChainGPT DAO on [dao.chaingpt.org](https://dao.chaingpt.org)&#x20;

### Voting Power

To gain voting power within the ChainGPT ecosystem, users are required to stake $CGPT tokens in any of the available staking pools. The longer users stake $CGPT the more voting power they get per $CGPT token.

* 15-day pool = 1x voting power per CGPT
* 45-day pool = 2x voting power per CGPT
* 185-day pool = 5x voting power per CGPT
* 365-day pool = 10x voting power per CGPT

Note: Farming pools (such as CGPT/BUSD) do not provide any voting power at this time.&#x20;

### In Conclusion

The ChainGPT DAO governance system is a critical component of the platform, as it enables community members to make important decisions that impact the platform's future growth and development. The voting power system is designed to ensure that the voices of long-term supporters and community members are heard and given greater weight in the decision-making process.

ChainGPT's DAO governance system provides a fair and democratic way for community members to collectively decide on the platform's future development. The staking pools available on ChainGPT incentivize users to hold their CGPT tokens for a longer period of time, which translates into more voting power, allowing users to have a greater say in the future of the platform.
