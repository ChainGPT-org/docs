### Setup API Key&#x20;

The ChainGPT API SDK uses API keys for authentication. In the Web app, Go to the SDK/ API module from the header menu, generate an API Key using the create secret key feature, and copy it.

### **Securing API Key**:

* It is crucial to secure your API keys to control access effectively.
* Avoid exposing the API keys in your code or public repositories.
* Store them in a secure location, and expose them to your application using environment variables or a secret management service.
* This method ensures you do not need to hard-code them in your codebase, enhancing security.

## Pricing

On sending each API request for NFT generation, 2 Credits will be deducted from the user account in WebApp.

Users can monitor and manage their credit usage via the [Webapp](https://app.chaingpt.org/), aligning with ChainGPT's user-centric approach to accessibility and transparency in service provision.&#x20;
