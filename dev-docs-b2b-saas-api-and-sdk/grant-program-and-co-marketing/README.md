### Examples of Grant-Funded Projects:&#x20;

To spark ideas, here are hypothetical examples:

* **AI Trading Agent for DeFi Applications:** A trading platform integrates an AI-powered assistant that enables users to schedule, simulate, and execute trades through a chatbot interface. The agent provides real-time market analysis, portfolio recommendations, and trade automation using ChainGPT’s Web3 LLM and AgenticOS.
* **NFT Marketplace with AI-Generated Content:** A new NFT marketplace incorporates the AI NFT Generator SDK, allowing users to create unique digital assets through natural language prompts. The platform streamlines the process from creation to minting and listing, enhancing user creativity and engagement.
* **Wallet Extension for Smart Contract Explanations:** A browser-based wallet adds a feature that enables users to input any smart contract address and receive a human-readable summary of its functionality and potential risks. Built with the Smart Contract Auditor SDK and Web3 LLM, this integration improves transparency and user trust.
* **Token & Protocol Intelligence Dashboard:** A crypto analytics platform integrates ChainGPT’s Web3 LLM and News API to provide users with AI-generated token summaries, protocol risk assessments, and real-time market insights. This improves the accessibility of complex blockchain data for researchers and investors.
* **DAO Tooling Platform with AI Proposal Auditing:** An existing DAO operations platform integrates ChainGPT’s Smart Contract Auditor SDK to automatically audit governance proposals and smart contract upgrades before submission. The AI assistant generates risk assessments, summarizes potential vulnerabilities, and helps DAO members make informed decisions. This integration improves governance transparency and reduces security risks across decentralized communities.
