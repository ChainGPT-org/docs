# Smart-Contracts Auditor (API & SDK)

## Smart-Contracts Auditor (API & SDK) - Overview

ChainGPT’s **AI Smart Contract Auditor** is an advanced developer tool that uses AI to automatically audit smart contracts for security vulnerabilities, logical bugs, gas inefficiencies, and compliance issues. It delivers quick, in-depth analysis of Solidity-based contracts, helping developers ensure their code is secure and optimized **before deployment**. The Auditor is accessible via a RESTful **API** and a convenient **Node.js SDK**, making it easy to integrate into your development workflow or products.

### **Key Capabilities:**

* **AI-Powered Vulnerability Detection:** Leverages ChainGPT’s Web3-trained AI engine to identify known **security vulnerabilities** (reentrancy, overflow/underflow, access control flaws, etc.) and even complex attack vectors. The AI deeply understands contract logic and intent, enabling it to catch subtle bugs and exploits that simple linters might miss.
* **Logic & Compliance Analysis:** Comprehends the contract’s behavior to ensure it aligns with intended functionality. It checks for **business logic errors** and verifies compliance with standards (e.g. ERC-20/721/4626) and best practices. It flags issues like centralization risks or missing permission checks, and confirms implementations follow **industry standards** and **governance requirements**.
* **Optimization Insights:** Identifies **gas inefficiencies** and suboptimal code patterns. The Auditor suggests improvements to save gas and optimize performance (e.g. unnecessary computations, expensive operations that could be cheaper). This helps you refine your contract for cost-effective on-chain execution.
* **Comprehensive Audit Reports:** For each run, the AI provides a clear **audit report** including an overall security score (0–100%), categorized findings by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational), detailed descriptions of each issue, and recommended fixes. Results are returned within **minutes**, complete with human-readable explanations and actionable remediation steps. You can also obtain the report as a structured **JSON** (via API/SDK) for programmatic use. (Full audit reports are coming in Q2 2025).

### **Key Benefits:**

* **Time-Efficient Audits:** Perform thorough audits in a fraction of the time compared to traditional manual security reviews. What might take a human auditor days or weeks is delivered by ChainGPT’s AI in **just a few minutes** – often faster than a single blockchain block time. This rapid feedback accelerates development without compromising security checks.
* **Cost Savings:** Manual smart contract audits can cost thousands of dollars. ChainGPT’s Auditor uses a simple **credit-based pricing** (1 credit per audit request) that reduces costs by up to **100×**. Developers and projects can iterate and re-audit frequently without breaking the budget, making security best-practices accessible even to small teams.
* **On-Chain Readiness:** The Auditor ensures your contract is **deployment-ready**. By catching critical issues pre-launch, it helps prevent costly exploits and failures in production. It supports multiple blockchains – Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, **and more** – so you can vet contracts across ecosystems. (There is also beta support for other environments like Solana’s Rust contracts.) This cross-chain coverage enhances security **due diligence** no matter where you deploy.
* **Seamless Integration:** Designed to slot into your development workflow, the Auditor can be used interactively or automated in pipelines. Use the API/SDK to run audits as part of your CI/CD process (for example, on each pull request or before deploying to mainnet) to continuously enforce security standards. It acts as an **additional layer of security** alongside code reviews and testing, boosting confidence in your code’s quality.

**Real-World Adoption:** ChainGPT’s Auditor is battle-tested in the field. For example, it was featured in TronDAO’s **HackaTRON** hackathon as an AI partner for smart contract tooling – allowing developers in the competition to quickly audit their Tron/EVM-based contracts. Many developers, projects, and even ecosystem partners (across Ethereum and BNB Chain communities) are already leveraging the Auditor to improve smart contract security and reliability.

**Upcoming Enhancements:** _By Q2 2025, ChainGPT plans to launch an **in-depth PDF report** feature._ This will provide a fully formatted, professional audit report (suitable for investors or compliance) comparable to those from leading security firms like CertiK. The PDF reports will include comprehensive findings and executive summaries, further solidifying the AI Auditor as a go-to solution for thorough smart contract audits.

### Pre-Deployment & CI/CD Integration

Integrating the ChainGPT Auditor into your **pre-deployment** checks or **CI/CD pipelines** can significantly strengthen your security posture. By automatically auditing each new smart contract (or each update) **before it’s deployed** to the blockchain, you catch vulnerabilities early when they are cheapest to fix. For example, you might add an Auditor API call in a GitHub Actions workflow or in your deployment script – if any High or Critical issues are found, the pipeline can fail the build, preventing an unsafe contract from going live. Because the Auditor runs quickly and through code, it fits naturally into continuous integration processes. This proactive approach (preventative security) helps avoid costly exploits and builds confidence that every contract version meets a baseline of security and quality before reaching production. In short, using ChainGPT’s Auditor in CI/CD ensures security is not an afterthought but a continuous, automated part of development.

* **Troubleshooting:** If you encounter issues using the API or SDK, consider the error messages returned. Common fixes include regenerating your API key (if you suspect an auth problem), ensuring your request format is correct, and confirming you have credits. The ChainGPT team is continuously improving the Auditor, so also ensure you have the latest SDK version.
* **Feedback & Updates:** Since the Auditor is an evolving product (with major updates planned, like the Q2 2025 enhancements), keep an eye on ChainGPT’s announcements for new features. You may need to update the SDK or adjust your integration to take advantage of new capabilities (such as retrieving PDF reports in the future). Providing feedback on your experience (e.g., via ChainGPT’s support channels) can also help improve the tool.

With this API and SDK, you have a high-quality, AI-driven smart contract security auditor at your fingertips. Integrate it into your development lifecycle to catch bugs early, ensure compliance, and ship robust smart contracts with confidence. Happy auditing!
