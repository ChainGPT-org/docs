# Bug Bounty Program

## ChainGPT Bug Bounty Program

The ChainGPT bug bounty program rewards developers and security experts for reporting vulnerabilities in the ChainGPT ecosystem. Our team has taken measures to minimize the potential impact of bugs and to ensure the highest level of software security.

In addition to these measures, we are offering a bug bounty for the core components of the ChainGPT ecosystem, as outlined in the Scope section below. This program helps us ensure that our software meets the highest standards and minimizes the risk of users losing funds.



### Scope

The scope of the bounty program includes:

* ChainGPT AI Model & Chatbot
* ChainGPT AI Based Tools & Utilities
* DevAssist Browser Extension
* ChainGPT Blockchain (Layer 1 & Layer 2)
* ChainGPT Blockchain Ecosystem (web wallet, wallet extension, explorer, Wormhole, DEX)
* ChainGPT Documentation: [https://github.com/chaingpt-org/](https://github.com/chaingpt/chaingpt-docs)docs



### Classification

#### Critical Bugs (awards up to $10,000 in GPT tokens)

&#x20;Critical bugs are those that result in loss of funds or cause network downtime. These may include vulnerabilities in the deployed and supported versions of the blockchain client, smart contracts, or other software outlined in the Scope section.

#### Non-Critical Bugs (awards up to $5,000 in GPT tokens)

&#x20;Non-critical bugs are those that do not cause financial loss or harm to the network's availability. These may impact the experience of developers or users and have a workaround.

Awards are subject to reclassification and verification by the ChainGPT team.



### How to Report

To report a bug, please follow these steps:

1. Describe the issue clearly in an email, including reference to the source code and classifying the bug as Critical or Non-critical.
2. Attach all relevant information needed to reproduce the bug in a test environment.
3. Include the version information for the faulty software component and any other relevant system information (e.g. OS version).
4. Provide suggested solutions or mitigations, if known.
5. Email your report to info@chaingpt.org with the subject line starting with either "Critical" or "Non-critical" followed by a brief title of the bug.

The ChainGPT team will review your report and classification, and respond within 2 business days to confirm if the bug qualifies for the bounty program or request more information. Updates on the bug fix will be posted on our Discord server, and Telegram channel.&#x20;

For non-critical bugs, the ChainGPT team will create an issue or pull request that you can track. For critical bugs that could result in funds loss, the fix will be shared after the code has been patched to prevent exploitation.
