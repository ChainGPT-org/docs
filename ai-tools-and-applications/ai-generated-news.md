### Overview of ChainGPT AI News Generator

Built from scratch, ChainGPT created an advanced AI News Agent to deliver an automated feed of sourced, organized, and presented information in real time.

News is vital for spreading important information. But it can also be controversial and biased. Crypto, blockchain, and Web3 are fast-moving industries with non-stop markets and constant information changes. Keeping up with Web3 news is challenging.

Staying updated can feel overwhelming. Sorting through endless information drains energy and makes it hard to find what matters. That’s why ChainGPT developed an AI-powered News Agent—to simplify the way we consume Web3 news.

* No more endless scrolling through social media.
* No more saving countless websites.
* No more biased publications.
* No more confusion.
* Just the facts.

### Introducing The ChainGPT Automated AI News Agent

ChainGPT’s AI News Agent searches the internet for breaking news from trusted Crypto/Web3 outlets like Decrypt, CoinDesk, and CoinTelegraph. It cross-references this with social signals from platforms like Twitter (X).

After gathering key information, the AI News Agent reads each article, identifies consistent truths, and summarizes the most important points. It highlights valuable insights and removes unnecessary details.

Unlike human-curated news sources that introduce personal opinions and biases, ChainGPT’s AI News Agent follows the algorithm. It operates autonomously with a self-checking system to ensure the accuracy of delivered news.

### Key Benefits

* Gathers real-time information from the internet
* Summarizes key points from multiple sources
* Removes unnecessary content for clarity
* Reduces human bias in reporting

Since the AI News Agent module is built into ChainGPT’s AI ecosystem, the chatbot also provides live market updates. You can access news by chatting with it via:

* The Official App Interface:[ https://app.chaingpt.org/](https://app.chaingpt.org/)
* The Telegram Group:[ https://t.me/chaingpt](https://t.me/chaingpt)
