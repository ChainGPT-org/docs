# Recognizing and Avoiding Scams in Web3

Though Web3 offers exciting opportunities, it also presents numerous risks, with scammers actively exploiting unwary users. In 2023 alone, scams accounted for losses of over $290 million.

### **Common Scams:**

* Phishing: Scammers create fake websites or send misleading emails to trick users into revealing sensitive information, which can lead to significant financial loss.
* Rug Pulls: Occur typically in new cryptocurrency projects where developers suddenly withdraw all funding, leaving a worthless project behind. This scam often follows a pattern of excessive hype and rapid investment withdrawal.
* Ponzi Schemes: These schemes promise high returns and rely on new investors' funds to pay returns to earlier participants, collapsing once the flow of new investors stops.

### **Identifying and Avoiding Scams:**

* Extensive Research: It is critical to investigate the project's team thoroughly, scrutinize the whitepaper, and check for audit reports by respected firms.
* Maintain Skepticism: Exercise caution with projects promising unrealistic returns and verify all information through multiple independent sources.

### **Action Steps if You Suspect a Scam:**

* Documentation: Collect all relevant transaction details and report the matter to appropriate authorities to help mitigate further exploitation.
* Protect Your Investments: If you suspect foul play, immediately move your assets to a more secure environment.
