<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To begin using the ChainGPT AI NFT Generator, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the [ChainGPT NFT Generator Dashboard](https://nft.chaingpt.org/).
2. Provide a text prompt that describes the desired NFT image.
3. Wait for the AI model to generate the image (typically 30–60 seconds).
4. Review the generated image and either approve and mint it or regenerate a new image.

That's it! You can create unique and captivating NFTs with just a few simple steps.

### Generation Options

The ChainGPT AI NFT Generator offers two distinct formats for generating NFTs:

**Option 1: Single NFT**

This option is best suited for results that require individual, specific attention. Whether you are an artist expressing your thoughts or a business needing abstract imagery, the Single NFT generator can cater to complex demands and deliver high-quality results.

**Option 2: Collection**

The Collection option is optimized for use cases that require large batches of unique art. Prominent applications include ticketing and community building. Rather than mass-printing redundant copies of tickets, you can provide your audience with distinguishable designs for their tickets. When building communities, generating collections from a single prompt ensures a visual bond that unites all members under the same principle.

* Collection size varies with a maximum cap of 10,000 images per request.

#### Prompting <a href="#prompting" id="prompting"></a>

The ChainGPT AI NFT Generator is designed to turn abstract ideas into visually compelling NFTs. There’s no rigid formula for writing the “perfect” prompt — creativity is your best tool. That said, clear and descriptive prompts typically yield more accurate and refined results.

Prompts can be anything from literal, like “White Rhino in Space,” to imaginative and surreal, like “Obsidian god wearing jewelry in a mansion.” The model is built to understand nuance, so don’t worry too much about spelling or grammar — it gets it.

**Need a boost?**

* Use “Enhance Prompt” to refine your ideas
* Tap “Surprise Me” for unexpected inspiration

Experiment freely and see how the AI brings your imagination to life.

#### Costs <a href="#costs" id="costs"></a>

To ensure accessibility, the ChainGPT AI NFT Generator has been designed with a cost structure that is significantly more affordable than traditional methods. Here are the current pricing details:​

* Unlimited generations for free on our Telegram and Discord Chatbots!
* 10 Single Image generations free daily.
* 1 CGPTc per generation thereafter, or when using Multi-NFT Collection.

### AI NFT Events

ChainGPT’s AI NFT Generator hosts dynamic NFT Events, providing users with opportunities to engage in themed challenges, giveaways, and collaborative projects.

### Marketplace Features

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The ChainGPT AI NFT Generator includes a fully integrated marketplace — built to simplify buying, selling, and discovering NFTs. Seamlessly connected with OpenSea, this hub allows creators to list their NFTs directly after minting, while buyers benefit from advanced search, filtering, and detailed views including creator info, price history, and transaction records. Users can favorite items, track listings with a watchlist, and view full ownership history — making the marketplace transparent, accessible, and optimized for visibility and engagement.
