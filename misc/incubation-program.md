# Incubation Program

_As a provider of AI-powered infrastructure for the crypto, blockchain, and Web3 industry, ChainGPT looks to support burgeoning projects interested in building on top of our technology._

There are abundant opportunities for builders, founders, and entrepreneurs in the Web3 space. There are always problems that need to be solved, communities that need to be built, and information that needs to be shared.

One sector that stands out amongst the crowd is Artificial Intelligence.

Considered to be the holy grail of technological innovation, AI is the epicenter of exploration in computer science. Not long after the inception of computing itself, cybernetics caught the attention of intelligence agencies worldwide, and the road of artificial intelligence began to be paved _(circa 1940s)._

Fast forward some odd \~75 years, breakthroughs in distributed technologies, cloud computing, information theory, and data science, coupled with the algorithmic advancements in engineering, and we arrive at the state of an AI renaissance today.

At the forefront of the revolution, we find startups building novel solutions at the intersection of AI and Web3 in an attempt to solve some of mankind's greatest problems.

ChainGPT is here to help these startups.
