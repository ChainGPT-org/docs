### What is Solidus AI Tech? <a href="#ff4b" id="ff4b"></a>

Based in Europe, Solidus AI Tech is a Web3 infrastrucutre and AI services company that has built their own 8,000 square foot facility to house the hardware that provisions their computational services. They are developing a full stack of cutting-edge software solutions including Artificial-Intelligence-as-a-service (AIaaS), Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS), High Performance Computing power (HPC), and an Artificial Intelligence marketplace.

As a provider of AI powered infrastructure to the Web3 industry, ChainGPT is stepping in to provide Solidus AITech with a full stack of technologies and advisory services to help them materialize their products and amplify their online presence.

Starting with our AI model and its deep domain expertise within the crypto, blockchain, and Web3 space, Solidus AI Tech will be plugging into our systems and streamlining their informational quality assurances while maximizing its accuracy.

Through the mentorship network of our incubator program, we have opened doors to and built relationships with some of the industryâ€™s leading Venture Capital firms and decentralized service providers for Solidus AITech to integrate with.

Harnessing the power of ChainGPTs social media presence, we have begun to educate over 300,000 $CGPT community members about the potential of Solidus AI Tech. Disseminating information as far and wide as possible has served well in bringing attention to their project and attracting early supporters of their mission.

## Synergies <a href="#54d8" id="54d8"></a>

Solidus AI Tech is among an ultra-exclusive select group of projects that have been accepted into the first generation of incubation by ChainGPT. The nature of their project within the category of artificial intelligence creates powerful synergies between them and us, leading to promising, fruitful, long-term relationships that transcend market cycles.
