### Review by DexCheck

ChainGPT has been a cornerstone in our journey, offering invaluable guidance across multiple aspects. Their expertise in go-to-market strategy and fundraising set us on a path for success, and the support we received on our launch day was second to none.

Their robust VC network of partners and connections were particularly helpful, allowing us to complete our fundraising stage fully, even during challenging bear market conditions.

The ChainGPT team has been an ideal partner, exemplifying professionalism and skill at every turn. Their collaborative approach complemented our efforts and made the whole process seamless.

Special mention must go to Ilan, the CEO of ChainGPT. His leadership, kindness, and positivity have not only motivated us but instilled a sense of purpose and direction that has been invaluable.

I can't thank ChainGPT team and Ilan enough for their steadfast support. Our successful token launch is a direct result of the robust ecosystem they've created, and we wholeheartedly recommend their incubator program to any aspiring projects.

— Raph, DexCheck CEO
