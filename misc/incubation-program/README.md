# Incubation Program

There are abundant opportunities for builders, founders, and entrepreneurs in the Web3 space. There are always problems that need to be solved, communities that need to be built, and information that needs to be shared.

One sector that stands out amongst the crowd is Artificial Intelligence.

Considered the holy grail of technological innovation, AI is the epicenter of exploration in computer science. Not long after the inception of computing, cybernetics caught the attention of intelligence agencies worldwide, and the road of artificial intelligence began to be paved _(circa 1940s)._

Fast forward some odd \~75 years, breakthroughs in distributed technologies, cloud computing, information theory, and data science, coupled with the algorithmic advancements in engineering, and we arrive at the state of an AI renaissance today.

At the forefront of the revolution, we find startups building novel solutions at the intersection of AI and Web3 to solve some of humanity's most significant problems.

ChainGPT is here to help these startups.

Using its architectural model built from scratch, ChainGPT has developed a sophisticated, domain-specific expert AI for application to all fundamental areas of the industry. From smart contract creation and auditing to NFT generation general education and everything in between.

Think of it as the ultimate Web3 assistant, a concierge with an ever-expanding database of knowledge that stays as fresh and recent on the state of the industry as the latest news.

### What is the objective of ChainGPT?

The driving force behind ChainGPT is to provide support across all sectors of the Web3 economy for integrating AI into their systems.
