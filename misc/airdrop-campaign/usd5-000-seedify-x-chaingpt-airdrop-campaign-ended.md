#### **Welcome to ChainGPT's airdrop campaign in partnership with Seedify!**&#x20;

As we prepare for our IDO launch on April 7th, we want to celebrate by giving our community $5,000 worth of CGPT and SFUND tokens.

To participate, all you need to do is complete a series of tasks that will qualify you for a chance to win. The more actions you complete, the greater your chances of being selected as one of the 100 winners, receiving $25 worth of CGPT and $25 worth of SFUND.

To get started, head to Seedify's website at https://launchpad.seedify.fund/ and follow the instructions. You can also visit ChainGPT's website at [https://www.chaingpt.org/](https://www.chaingpt.org/) to learn more about our AI model and its capabilities in the blockchain and crypto space.

We're thrilled to partner with Seedify for our IDO launch and to offer this airdrop campaign to our community. Take advantage of this opportunity to unleash the power of blockchain AI with ChainGPT and Seedify. Good luck!

**Thank you for being a part of the ChainGPT community. Good luck!**
