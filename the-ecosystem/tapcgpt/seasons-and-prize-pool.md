At the conclusion of each season, TapCGPT players are eligible to win various rewards based on their in-game points. The rewards include:

* **ChainGPT Pad Tiers**: Exclusive tiers awarded to the top 5,000 players, granting access to participate in IDOs (Initial DEX Offerings) and other benefits on the ChainGPT Pad.
* **Ecosystem Credits**: Credits valued between $300,000 and $500,000, usable across the ChainGPT ecosystem.
* **Prize Pool Value**: A total of over $3,000,000 in rewards dedicated to Season 1.

**Important Considerations**:

* **Season Duration**: Each season lasts 90 days.
* **Reward Claims**: Rewards are not automatically airdropped and must be manually claimed by players.

The following sections explain how to earn these rewards and what each category includes.

**1. Crypto Prizes: Earn as You Play**

One of the primary incentives for playing TapCGPT is the opportunity to earn real cryptocurrency. Each season, the total crypto prize pool ranges from $150,000 to $300,000 in $CGPT tokens, with an additional $50,000 to $100,000 in incubation tokens.

**How It Works**:

* **Points Accumulation**: Players earn points by tapping, completing challenges, and progressing through game levels.
* **Reward Calculation**: At the end of the season, the total prize pool is divided by the total number of points earned by all players. This calculation determines the value of each point in terms of $CGPT.
* **Airdrop Eligibility**: Players who have accumulated enough points to earn at least $1 in rewards are eligible to claim their share. The basic formula for calculating rewards is as follows:
  * **Value per Point** = Prize Pool / Total Points
  * **Your Reward** = Value per Point \* Your Points

**Example**: Assuming the total prize pool is $200,000 and the total points accumulated by all players are 500,000,000:

* **Value per Point** = $200,000 / 500,000,000 = $0.0004 per point
* **Your Reward** = 500,000 points \* $0.0004 = $200 in $CGPT tokens

**2. ChainGPT Pad Tiers: Exclusive Access for Top Players**

In addition to $CGPT tokens, TapCGPT rewards the top 5,000 players with exclusive ChainGPT Pad tiers, offering various benefits.

**Tier Distribution**:

* **Diamond Tier**: Awarded to the top 30 players (+200,000 CGPTsp)
* **Gold Tier**: Awarded to players ranked 31-100 (+50,000 CGPTsp)
* **Silver Tier**: Awarded to players ranked 101-750 (+20,000 CGPTsp)
* **Bronze Tier**: Awarded to players ranked 751-5,000 (+2,000 CGPTsp)

**Tier Benefits**:

* **Access to IDOs**: These tiers allow players to participate in IDOs on the ChainGPT Pad.
* **90-Day Validity**: The tiers are valid for 90 days, providing a temporary boost that can enhance staking opportunities.
* **Value**: The tiers have a collective value of approximately $2,500,000, based on the CGPT tokens required for a 2x multiplier stake.
* **DegenPad Access**: 50% of the staking points are also applicable to DegenPad.

**3. Ecosystem Credits: Spend and Save**

Players also earn ecosystem credits, which can be used across the ChainGPT ecosystem. These credits, valued between $300,000 and $500,000, are distributed based on the number of points earned during the season.

**How to Use Ecosystem Credits**:

* **Spending Options**: Ecosystem credits can be utilized for various services and products within the ChainGPT ecosystem, including platforms such as app.chaingpt.org and nft.chaingpt.org.
* **Automatic Assignment**: Credits are automatically assigned to eligible players at the end of the season, eliminating the need for separate claims.
