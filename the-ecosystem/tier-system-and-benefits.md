# Tier System & Benefits

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Partnership announcement  [Template] (1).gif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The ChainGPT ecosystem has implemented a four-tiered system. This structure aims to give every $CGPT token holder an equal voice, regardless of their token count. Moreover, it includes rewards suitable for individuals of varied financial backgrounds.

Tiers represent the degree of a user's commitment to the ChainGPT ecosystem as defined by the simple formula of 1) capital in the form of $CGPT tokens and 2) the duration they get locked up for. The more tokens a user stakes, the more CGPTsp they acquire; the longer the duration of the stake, the higher the multiplier on their CGPTsp.

***

### Tier Structure

Four distinct tiers have been established: bronze, silver, gold, and diamond. Every tier has its own CGPT(sp) requirements and provides its own unique set of benefits.

<details>

<summary>ðŸ¥‰ Bronze Tier</summary>

_This entry-level tier is explicitly designed for users with limited capital capacities._&#x20;

_**Points Required:** >2,000+_\
\
_**ChainGPT AI Ecosystem Benefits:**_\
_- Freemium AI Tools Access: No_\
_- DAO Voting Rights: Yes_\
_- Can Create DAO Proposals: No_\
_- Free Incubation Airdrops: No_\
_- Early Access to ChainGPT Apps: No_\
\
_**ChainGPT Pad Benefits:**_\
\- _Pool Weight: 1x Allocation Multiplier_\
\- _Refund Eligibility: Yes, 100%_\
\- _Participation rounds: #2 (FCFS)_&#x20;

The Bronze tier does not provide access to the _**first/guaranteed round.** M_embers in this tier group are granted the right to only participate in the second/FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve) round. Occasionally, social campaigns (via Gleam / Galxe / TaskOn) will be launched in tandem with new IDO releases that will allow bronze-tier members to earn whitelist allocations for the first rounds.

<summary>ðŸ¥ˆ Silver Tier</summary>

### ðŸ¥ˆ Silver Tier

_Silver is the second level tier and the first one that provides guaranteed access to the first round of participation in IDOs._

\
_**ChainGPT AI Ecosystem Benefits:**_\
_- Freemium AI Tools Access: No_\
_- DAO Voting Rights: Yes_\

\
_**ChainGPT Pad Benefits:**_\
\- _Pool Weight: Minimum 4x Allocation Multiplier_\
\- _Refund Eligibility: Yes, 100%_\
\- _Participation rounds: #1 and #2 (Guaranteed and FCFS)_

The most commonly sought-after level due to the inclusion into all IDO rounds. Silver tier members are also granted a guaranteed whitelist placement for the launch of ChainGPT's official NFT collection.

<summary>ðŸ¥‡ Gold Tier</summary>

### ðŸ¥‡ Gold Tier

_Gold is the second highest tier and the first one that provides access to premium early-stage crowdfunding and private sales._

_**Points Required:** 50,000+_\
\
_**ChainGPT AI Ecosystem Benefits:**_\
_- Freemium AI Tools Access: No_\
_- DAO Voting Rights: Yes_\
_- Can Create DAO Proposals: No_\
_- Free Incubation Airdrops: Yes_\
_- Early Access to ChainGPT Apps: Yes_\
\
_**ChainGPT Pad Benefits:**_\
\- _Pool Weight: Minimum 10x Allocation Multiplier_\
\- _Refund Eligibility: Yes, 100%_\
\- _Participation rounds: #1 and #2 (Guaranteed and FCFS)_

In the Gold Tier, benefits for members expand to include opportunities for participating in pre-public stages of new project launches (private sales). Likewise, the Gold tier members will be guaranteed whitelist placements for participating in the official ChainGPT NFT collection launch.

One of the most appealing drivers of the Gold tier is the unlocked IDO allocation claims. For every IDO launched on ChainGPT Pad, a portion of the tokens collected will be distributed among gold & diamond tier members.

</details>

<details>

<summary>ðŸ’Ž Diamond Tier</summary>

_Diamond is the highest and most desirable tier for launchpad participants, given the breadth of benefits it offers. Being the only tier that provides complementary tokens & NFT airdrops, Diamond tier users are reimbursed for their commitments passively._

_**Points Required:** 200,000+_\
\
_**ChainGPT AI Ecosystem Benefits:**_\
_- Freemium AI Tools Access: Yes_\
_- DAO Voting Rights: Yes_\
_- Can Create DAO Proposals: Yes_\
_- Free Incubation Airdrops: Yes_\
_- Early Access to ChainGPT Apps: Yes_\
\
_**ChainGPT Pad Benefits:**_\
\- _Pool Weight: Minimum 40x Allocation Multiplier_\
\- _Refund Eligibility: Yes, 100%_\
\- _Participation rounds: #1 and #2 (Guaranteed and FCFS)_

As with earlier (non-bronze) levels, members of the Diamond tier receive access to both IDO rounds. Likewise with the preceding Gold Tier, one of the most appealing drivers for Diamond tier members is the unlocked IDO allocation claims. For every IDO launched on ChainGPT Pad, a portion of the tokens collected will be distributed among Gold & Diamond tier members. Of course, the proportional allocation is more significant for higher-tier members.

Diamond tier members also receive additional incentives from the ChainGPT partnership network through priority NFT distributions and private token allocations.

The Diamond Tier is the only one that pushes the benefits beyond the realm of the ChainGPT Pad and into other vectors of ChainGPT's ecosystem, namely Freemium tools and DAO proposal rights.&#x20;

Here, members are automatically granted unlimited access to all ChainGPT AI tools and receive monthly CGPTc balance refills of up to 20,000 credits. Thereby incentivizing membership at his level with ecosystemic participation in every possible manner.

Diamond Tier members also happen to be the only group of community members who are endowed with the ability to submit proposals. While any $CGPT token holder is allowed to participate in steering the outcomes of decisions, only Diamond Tier members can push the suggestions for community deliberations.
