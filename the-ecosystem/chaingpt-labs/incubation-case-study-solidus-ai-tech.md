### What is Solidus AI Tech? <a href="#ff4b" id="ff4b"></a>

Based in Europe, Solidus AI Tech is a Web3 infrastructure and AI services company that has built their own 8,000 square foot facility to house the hardware that provisions their computational services. They are developing a full stack of cutting-edge software solutions including Artificial-Intelligence-as-a-service (AIaaS), Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS), High Performance Computing power (HPC), and an Artificial Intelligence marketplace.

### What support ChainGPT has provided to Solidus AI Tech? <a href="#c7c4" id="c7c4"></a>

As a provider of AI-powered infrastructure to the Web3 industry, ChainGPT stepped in to provide Solidus AI Tech with a full stack of technologies and advisory services to help them materialize their products and amplify their online presence. Beginning with our AI model and its deep domain expertise within the crypto, blockchain, and Web3 space, Solidus AI Tech plugged into our systems, streamlining their informational quality assurances and maximizing accuracy.

Through our incubator program's mentorship network, we opened doors and forged relationships with some of the industry's leading Venture Capital firms and decentralized service providers for Solidus AI Tech to integrate with. Leveraging ChainGPT's social media presence, we educated over 300,000 $CGPT community members about the potential of Solidus AI Tech. Spreading information far and wide proved successful in garnering attention for their project and attracting early supporters of their mission.
