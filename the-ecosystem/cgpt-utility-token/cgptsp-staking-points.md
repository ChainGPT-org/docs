### What are CGPTsp?

CGPTsp stands for ChainGPT staking points, a weighted accounting system used to determine the degree of commitment a user has to the ChainGPT ecosystem based on the factors of their total amount of tokens staked and the duration of their stakes.

### What is the purpose of CGPTsp?

CGPTsp plays a vital role in creating a balanced socioeconomic environment that gives less capitalized actors an opportunity to have a greater impact on the overall ecosystem.&#x20;

The more CGPTsp an account is attributed with, the more governance power it will have, the higher the tier in the ChainGPT Pad it will unlock, and the greater its opportunities for yield are.

### CGPTsp Calculation

The algorithm for calculating CGPTsp has been kept maximally simple, leveraging just two parameters: the total number of tokens and the pool specifications to which it is committed.

> Total $CGPT tokens staked **\*** the pool multiplier = Staking Points

**Token Weight:**\
_**One**_ staked $CGPT token equals _**one**_ staking point.

**Pool Multiplier Weight:**

Pool Multipliers are the weighted portion that is derived from the parameters of lockup durations and yield sizes; the longer the lockup, the higher the yield, the higher the multiplier.

**Pool Options:**\
ChainGPT offers a multitude of staking modules that each carry its own unique specifications and opportunities:

**45 days** = **1x** points multiplier | 1% APY\
**90 days** = **1.3x** points multiplier | 3% APY\
**180 days** = **1.5x** points multiplier | 5% APY\
**365 days** = **2x** points multiplier | 8% APY\
**365 days** = **2.5x** points multiplier | 0% APY
