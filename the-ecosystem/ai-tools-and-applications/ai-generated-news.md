> Built from scratch, ChainGPT has developed an advanced algorithm for an automated feed of Intelligently Sourced, organized, and presented Information on demand in real-time.

News is the informational lifeblood for the propagation of fundamental information.&#x20;

They are arguably the most controversial, biased sectors in those industries. Considering that crypto, blockchain, and Web3 is already notorious for their unorthodox 24-hour markets and endless floods of information that change multiple times intra-day, news in Web3 has been among the most difficult to organize clearly.&#x20;

Staying updated requires intellectual gymnastics and exerting excessive efforts that drain people’s cognitive capacities, making it difficult to decipher the noise from the key points of value. That is precisely why ChainGPT has developed an AI-powered algorithm and service that takes news within our nascent industry to new heights.

* No more mindless scrolling through social media in search of answers.
* No more bookmarking 1,000 different sites.
* No more authorship or publication biases.
* No more confusion on what to focus on.
* Just the facts.

It is with tremendous pleasure that we introduce to you

#### The ChainGPT Automated AI News

Searching the far corners of cyberspace for breaking news from Crypto/Web3’s trusted news outlets such as Decrypt, CoinDesk, and CoinTelegraph (among many others), the ChainGPT AI News agent understands that news breaks beyond just headlines and cross-references it with social confirmation signals from platforms like Twitter.

Once the most critical information has been aggregated, the AI new agent ingests it all, reading every single article to decipher what is consistently true across all sources, extrapolates the most valuable nuggets, and writes up succinct summarizations highlighting only what the reader stands to gain the most benefits from while truncating all excess fluff.

One of the key breakthroughs in the automated AI news agents here is the removal of dependence on human intervention. Humans always have an angle, a point of view, and an underlying agenda. AI does what the algorithm specifies. ChainGPT has devised a sophisticated self-checking system for the newsagent that guarantees the newsfeed's accuracy.

#### Key Benefits

* Scrapes & learns about things around the internet in real-time.
* Summarizations with a focus on key value points
* Removal of excesses
* Minimization of human bias

#### Applications

The automated AI news agent’s applications can be drawn directly to the audience and use cases to which it caters to.
