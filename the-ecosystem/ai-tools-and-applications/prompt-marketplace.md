# Prompt Marketplace

Rooted in the concept of I/O, where an input's quality directly influences the output's quality, prompts are the foundation of generative AI capabilities.&#x20;

Carefully crafted instruction sets used to interact with a generative Artificial Intelligence software/agent, prompts are a novel type of digital asset that radical new economic opportunities are springing up around.&#x20;

As AI becomes more ingrained in commercial and personal life, the demand for understanding how to interact with it grows accordingly. The ability to create effective, accurate prompts has unlocked new revenue sources for individuals around the world.

It has been designed as a two-sided marketplace connecting individuals or businesses that need generative ideas with prompt engineers who create them.&#x20;
