# Crypto Wallet Security 101

Effective management and protection of digital assets in Web 3.0 necessitate a thorough understanding of wallet types and security features. Selecting the right storage option and implementing robust security measures are vital to safeguarding your investments.



### **Types of Wallets:**

* Custodial Wallets: Third-party services offer these wallets, which manage your private keys and transactions. While convenient, they expose users to risks if the provider's security is compromised.
* Non-Custodial Wallets: These give users complete control over their assets by allowing them to manage their private keys and transactions directly. This independence increases security but also places greater responsibility on the user.

### **Wallet Security Practices:**

* Hardware Wallets: These devices, which often resemble USB drives, provide a secure way to manage private keys and perform transactions. Their physical nature requires anyone attempting to access the wallet to have the device in hand, greatly reducing the risk of online theft.
* Hot Wallets: These digital wallets are more accessible and vulnerable to security threats. Strong security protocols, such as robust passwords and two-factor authentication, are vital.

### **Common Vulnerabilities and Prevention:**

* Phishing: A common tactic where attackers impersonate legitimate services to steal credentials.
* Malware Attacks: These can infiltrate devices through downloads or deceptive links. Maintaining updated anti-malware software is crucial.
* Bugs in Wallet Software: Developers frequently update wallet software to fix vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit.
