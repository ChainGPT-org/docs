### Generation Options

The ChainGPT AI NFT Generator offers two distinct formats for generating NFTs:

**Option 1: Single NFT**

This option is best suited for results that require individual, specific attention. Whether you are an artist expressing your thoughts or a business needing abstract imagery, the Single NFT generator can cater to complex demands and deliver high-quality results.

**Option 2: Collection**

The Collection option is optimized for use cases that require large batches of unique art. Prominent applications include ticketing and community building. Rather than mass-printing redundant copies of tickets, you can provide your audience with distinguishable designs for their tickets. When building communities, generating collections from a single prompt ensures a visual bond that unites all members under the same principle.

* Collection size varies with a maximum cap of 10,000 images per request.

#### Prompting <a href="#prompting" id="prompting"></a>

The ChainGPT AI NFT Generator complements abstract thinking and brings arbitrary concepts to life. There is no hardcoded universal framework for perfect prompting; the best prompts produce the desired results. However, providing accurate and descriptive prompts generally leads to more accurate outcomes.

Prompts can range from concrete and straightforward examples like "White Rhino In Space" to more abstract ones like "Obsidian God Wearing Jewelry in a Mansion." Feel free to experiment and explore the generator to understand how it interprets your ideas.

* Spelling and grammar: Don't worry, the ChainGPT AI model is advanced and can comprehend linguistic nuances.

#### Costs <a href="#costs" id="costs"></a>

To ensure accessibility, the ChainGPT AI NFT Generator has been designed with a cost structure that is significantly more affordable than traditional methods. Here are the current pricing details:​

* Unlimited generations for free on our Telegram and Discord Chatbots!
* 10 Single Image generations free daily.
* 2 CGPTc per generation thereafter, or when using Multi-NFT Collection.

#### Security Features <a href="#security-features" id="security-features"></a>

We've implemented enhanced platform security with reCAPTCHA, verifying user interactions to prevent spam and malicious activities. Our security measures are designed to protect both creators and buyers, ensuring a trustworthy environment.

To maintain community standards and ensure a safe platform environment, administrators have the ability to block specific AI NFT collections or wallet addresses.

#### Limitations <a href="#limitations" id="limitations"></a>

The ChainGPT AI NFT Generator's outcomes depend on the creativity of the prompter. While the AI model is powerful, the quality and relevance of the generated images can vary based on the prompts provided. Feel free to try it out and explore the possibilities for yourself.
