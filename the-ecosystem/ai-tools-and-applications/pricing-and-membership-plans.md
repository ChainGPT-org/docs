# Pricing & Membership Plans

### 3-Tier Membership System

ChainGPT has three memberships, each providing unique access to the suite of [ChainGPT AI tools](https://app.chaingpt.org/); every membership level requires users to have an account with ChainGPT.

Instantiating an account links any Web3 wallet (Metamask, Trust Wallet, Rainbow Wallet, etc.) to the ChainGPT application dashboard. When a wallet is connected, an account is created, and users can click the right of their screens to inspect their profiles.

***

### 1️⃣ Free Plan:

The entry-level membership contains the basic configuration of essential functions granted to every account. To acquire the "Free" plan, users must connect their Web3 wallet.

Restricted from any advanced applications, the Free plan provides limited daily access to:

* General AI model (Chatbot) – 50 free requests
* Smart Contract Auditor – 10 free requests
* Smart Contract Generator – 10 free requests
* AI Trading Assistant – 20 free requests
* Ask Crypto People – 50 free messages
* Unlimited access to AI News Generator and CryptoGuard
* Single NFT Generation and participation in the Prompt Marketplace\
  \

### 2️⃣ PPP (Pay Per Prompt) Plan

Geared to a more sophisticated audience, plan two provides flexible, unlimited access to the entire ChainGPT application suite with no commitments required.

As the name might imply, the "PPP" plan is based on a dynamic demand model where users need access but are uncertain about how much access they need. Pay as you go only for what you need.

The pay-per-prompt plan offers total access to the entire application suite. Everything available in the Free plan is included, with additional access to tools and services once free usage is exceeded, including advanced use of the Smart Contract Generator, Smart Contract Auditor, multi-NFT (collection) generation, the AI Trading Assistant, and API/SDK calls.

### 3️⃣ Freemium Plan

Unlocking the full spectrum of functionality with unlimited premium access and revolving monthly CGPTc balance refills.

To acquire the Freemium membership, users must stake $CGPT tokens and accumulate >200,000 CGPTsp (staking points). Once qualifying for the "Freemium" membership, users will also have their ecosystem tiers upgraded to Diamond and be imbued with the rights to submit proposals to the ChainGPT DAO for the community to vote on.

Once per month, members of the "Freemium" plan will have their accounts balanced with 20,000 CGPTc (ChainGPT credits). These credits may be used for any utilities the user desires or can be left unused. They do not roll over, and balances are topped off to the 20,000 CGPTc level.

For example, if you became Freemium in February and had your account filled to 20,000 CGPTc but only used 3,500, your account would be left with 16,500 at the start of March. In March, your account balance will update to 20,000 again. If you do not use the CGPTc, your balance will remain flat month-to-month.

### Product Pricing 💸

Leveraging a maximally flexible pricing model to be as inclusive to as broad an audience as possible while reserving the more advanced services for users with higher demands, ChainGPT has adopted what it believes to be the most effective pricing structure for Web3 AI.

Generally speaking, there are two calibers of pricing: those that require nothing at all (Free) and those that need the consumption of CGPTc (Paid).
