# Pricing and usage tracking

## The General Chatbot SDK Pricing

The General Chatbot SDK from ChainGPT operates on a credit-based system. Each request made through the SDK deducts 0.5 CGPTc from the user's account. This model facilitates a pay-per-use structure, ensuring that users only pay for what they need, allowing for both flexibility and scalability.

Stream Response: Each chat API request costs 0.5 CGPTc. Enabling chat history will result in an additional 0.5 CGPTc deduction.

BLOB Response: Similar to Stream Response, each request deducts 0.5 CGPTc, and chat history incurs an extra 0.5 CGPTc cost.

Users can monitor and manage their credit usage via the Web App, which aligns with ChainGPT's user-centric approach to accessibility and transparency in service provision.

For additional details or to manage your credits, users should visit the ChainGPT Webapp.

### Smart Contract Auditor & Generator SDK

Stream Response:\
On sending each LLM Chatbot request, 1 CGPTc is deducted for the Smart Contract Auditor and 2 CGPTc for the Smart Contract Generator.

In addition, if the user enables the chat history feature, an additional 1 CGPTc is deducted.

Blob Response:\
On sending each API request, the same credit amounts apply: 1 CGPTc for the Auditor, 2 CGPTc for the Generator. Enabling chat history also incurs 1 CGPTc extra.

Get Chat History:\
Since the user has already enabled the chat history feature while calling the stream/blob response chat API, no additional credits will be deducted for the Get credit history API.
