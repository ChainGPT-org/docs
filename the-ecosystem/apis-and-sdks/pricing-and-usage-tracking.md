# Pricing and usage tracking

## The General Chatbot SDK  Pricing

The General Chatbot SDK from ChainGPT operates on a credit-based system. Each request made through the SDK deducts one credit from the user's account. This model facilitates a pay-per-use structure, ensuring that users only pay for what they need, allowing for both flexibility and scalability.&#x20;

1. **Stream Response**: Each chat API request costs 1 Credit. Enabling chat history will result in an additional credit deduction.
2. **BLOB Response**: Similar to Stream Response, each request deducts 1 Credit, with chat history also incurring an extra credit cost.

Users can monitor and manage their credit usage via the [Webapp](https://app.chaingpt.org/), aligning with ChainGPT's user-centric approach to accessibility and transparency in service provision.&#x20;

For additional details or to manage your credits, users should visit the ChainGPT [Webapp](https://app.chaingpt.org/).
