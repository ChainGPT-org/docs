Smart contracts are the fundamental building blocks of decentralized applications.

The development of Smart contracts is the cornerstone upon which Web3 relies on to bring the vision of a decentralized, digital economy to fruition.&#x20;

Coding a smart contract from scratch is a labor-intensive, detail-oriented process that commonly includes large expenditures of time in the quality assurance processes prior to deployment.&#x20;

Aimed at accelerating innovation and improving prototyping quality by an order of magnitude, ChainGPT has tuned the capabilities of its AI model to create smart contracts on-demand.

ChainGPT's AI Model has been fed all of the information that pertains to smart contract code, including best security practices, libraries, samples of standardization, effective live contracts, samples of failures, and a slew of micro-nuances (such as solidity syntax).&#x20;

### Benefits:

**Speed of Iteration**&#x20;

ChainGPT is able to create an entirely unique smart contract with just a few prompts.&#x20;

Depending on the complexity of the smart contract code, it is within reason to anticipate creation times sub 1 minute.

**Low Capital Expenditure**

The ChainGPT Smart Contract Generator has a fixed, ultra-low (per call/prompt) cost. Falling into the sub $1 cost bracket, generating a smart contract will now become something accessible to a new generation of developers and entrepreneurs that do not have prior experience.

**Broad Contract Types**

The ChainGPT Smart Contract Generator is capable of creating a wide range of application and logic types, including simpler, more common things, such as fungible tokens to more complex and sophisticated things, such as AMM DEXs for NFTs.
