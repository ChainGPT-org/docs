## ChainGPT Pad IDO Launch Process

ChainGPT Pad employs a two-phased approach to IDO launches, designed to encourage commitment from the CGPT user base and maximize opportunities for projects to complete their sales.\

**Pre-Order Access (Diamond Tier Only)**

Pre-Order access is exclusive to Diamond Tier members, providing additional time to participate in the IDO before the general Guaranteed Round opens.

• Duration: 12 hours.

• Access: Diamond Tier members only.

• Purpose: Allows top-tier members early access to the IDO.\


**Round #1 (Guaranteed Allocation)**

• Duration: A minimum of 24 hours.

• Eligibility: Silver, Gold, and Diamond Tier members, with a limited number of Bronze Tier members earning access through social campaigns.

**Round #2 (FCFS - First Come First Serve)**

The second round operates on a First Come, First Serve basis and is open to the broader ChainGPT community. No prior registration is needed, but participants should be aware that the sale could close early if the full capacity is reached.
