# IDO Rounds Explained

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/cgpt-pad-rounds.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

ChainGPT Pad leverages a two-phased approach for conducting the launches of IDO projects.&#x20;

By having multiple rounds, a higher degree of commitment from the CGPT user base can be established, and a larger potential opportunity for projects to successfully complete their intended sales.&#x20;

### **Round #1 (Guaranteed Allocation)**

Round one of an IDO will be granted only to the users who signal their desire to participate by registering their interest prior to the start of the IDO. (Typically_, Registration will open a week prior and last until 24 hours before launch_).

This round is reserved for the top staking tier groups, Silver, Gold, and Diamond. However, every IDO is launched through social campaigns that allow a limited group of fast-acting Bronze tier members to earn their inclusion into the guaranteed round.

Round #1 will last for 24 hours unless otherwise specified.

### **Round #2 (FCFS - First Come First Serve)**

Round two, the First Come First Serve, is open to the broader ChainGPT community. There is no requirement to register interest for FCFS; however, waiting for it runs the risk of users being unable to participate due to early completion. Here, all KYC tier members can join at will.

Round #2 will last for 12 hours unless otherwise specified.

_In the event that a project meets its maximum IDO capacity during the first round of guaranteed allocations, the IDO shall immediately halt and complete. This renders the FCFS round no longer applicable to the IDO._
