# KYC Onboarding Guide

> ChainGPT's launchpad conducts due diligence processes on behalf of both the projects that are listed and the users that will be participating. In order to maintain the highest level of integrity and ensure quality control (by disincentiving Sybil takeover attempts), KYC has been implemented to verify the identities of all users. \
> \
> This is a user guide for preparing to participate in the ChainGPT Pad.

A pop-up will appear with three actions to prompt:

**1)** Check the box to accept the Terms and Conditions,\
**2)** Choose the Network _(every IDO will have its own specifications, so select the one that is relevant to the native chain the project you wish to participate in is using)_.\
**3)** Select your wallet provider.

On average, Blockpass requires up to 48 hours to process your information.&#x20;

You will be kept updated about the status of your applications via email.

### **8. Updated Account Status — Welcome!**

As soon as Blockpass successfully processes your form, your profile dashboard will automatically be updated.&#x20;

Monitor the page for the account status switch from a red “_unverified_” to a green “_verified_”
