# One Wallet Connect - Unified Wallet Integration Guide

## Overview

Our unified wallet integration significantly simplifies and enhances user accessibility to Initial DEX Offerings (IDOs) across multiple blockchain networks, including Solana and various EVM-compatible chains.&#x20;

This integration addresses common user pain points by eliminating the need to manage multiple wallets simultaneously. Now, users can independently connect their Solana or EVM wallet based on the pool they're interacting with.

The biggest improvement is with Solana: users no longer need to have both wallets connected. Once a Solana wallet is linked to an EVM wallet via the user profile, users can fully interact with Solana pools using only their Solana wallet.

Below, you can find the necessary steps to get started on [ChainGPT Pad](https://app.gitbook.com/u/vt7ouO7Toga7R4fjv601TLYsQCx2) with Solana.

**Please note**: If you don’t have a ChainGPT account, please set one up and return to this guide.



### Step 1 - Connect your wallet

Head over to ChainGPT Pad. In the top right corner, click “Connect Wallet”.&#x20;

A wallet connect window will pop up; click your preferred EVM wallet and ensure you choose Ethereum as your network.

A window from your wallet will appear. After you ask to connect, click “Connect” and sign the signature.

You will now be logged into ChainGPT Pad.&#x20;



### Step 2 - Linking Solana&#x20;

You now want to navigate to your ChainGPT Pad profile by clicking the person icon at the top right corner.&#x20;

Once in your profile, click “Profile Settings”. On the right-hand side, you will see the “Wallets” section.&#x20;

At the top, you should have the option to connect your Solana wallet. Click “Connect Solana Wallet”.

A drop-down will appear, showing the address associated with your Solana Wallet. Click “Link Solana Wallet”.&#x20;

Sign the transaction in MetaMask and ensure the address matches yours correctly.

You have now successfully linked your Solana wallet with your EVM. You are also able to connect up to three Solana wallets per ChainGPT Pad profile



### Step 3 - Getting Involved with Solana Pools

You’re now fully connected. The next thing you want to do is get involved with the Solana pools on ChainGPT Pad.

Firstly, log out of your EVM wallet by clicking on the address at the top right corner. A box will appear; click “Disconnect.”&#x20;

Switch from Ethereum to Solana. Then click “Connect Wallet” and choose your Solana-based wallet. Select Solana as the chain for your wallet.&#x20;

You are now ready to get involved with Solana pools and claim your tokens! \


Only once all the steps above are completed can you begin participating in IDOs and claiming tokens on ChainGPT Pad.&#x20;
