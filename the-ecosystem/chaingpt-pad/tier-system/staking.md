# Staking

#### **Staking & Points System:**

The staking system for becoming a Launchpad-qualified member is based on a straightforward point system. Two factors come into the accounting of points: the token amount staked and the duration of the stake. Combining the two will place members into one of the four possible tier categories: Bronze/Silver/Gold/Diamond.

_**1 $CGPT is equal to 1 point**_\
Each stake pool duration will bring its own point multiplier:

**45 days** (1% APY) = **1x** points multiplier\
**90 days** (3% APY) = **1.3x** points multiplier\
**180 days** (5% APY) = **1.5x** points multiplier\
**365 days** (8% APY) = **2x** points multiplier
