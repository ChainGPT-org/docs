### Overview

ChainGPT Pad provides multiple avenues for users to participate in token distributions through its Giveaways and Launchdrops. These initiatives are designed to reward active community members and investors while also fostering engagement with emerging Web3 projects.

Both Giveaways and Launchdrops provide value by allowing users to receive tokens without requiring additional investments beyond their existing participation in the ChainGPT Pad ecosystem.&#x20;

This document outlines the mechanisms, eligibility requirements, and distinctions between these two distribution models to help users understand how they can take full advantage of these opportunities.

### Giveaways on ChainGPT Pad

Giveaways are exclusive reward distributions for participants of projects that have conducted an Initial DEX Offering (IDO) on ChainGPT Pad or DegenPad.&#x20;

These giveaways serve as an additional benefit for investors who support projects through IDOs and choose not to refund their contributions.

#### Eligibility Criteria

* Users must have participated in the corresponding IDO.
* Refund requests disqualify users from the giveaway.
* Allocation is based on the [user's tier](https://www.chaingpt.org/blog/chaingpt-launchpad-tier-system-staking?_gl=1*14zivz4*_gcl_au*MTIxNjYzNTMyLjE3MzYzMzA2ODk.) within the ChainGPT Pad [staking system](https://www.chaingpt.org/blog/chaingpt-launchpad-tier-system-staking?_gl=1*1vqngeb*_gcl_au*MTIxNjYzNTMyLjE3MzYzMzA2ODk.).

#### Giveaway Process

1. Participation: Users eligible for the giveaway must confirm their participation by registering during the period of the registration round.
2. Allocation Calculation: Token distribution follows the same tier-based approach as IDOs.
3. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Mechanism: Unclaimed tokens at the end of the giveaway period are reallocated among eligible participants, potentially increasing their final allocation.
4. Claiming Tokens: Once finalized, users can claim their allocated tokens through their ChainGPT Pad dashboard. Note that a vesting schedule with linear distribution applies, which may vary from one project to another.

#### Notable Giveaways

One of the largest giveaways on ChainGPT Pad was for [Solidus AI Tech](https://pad.chaingpt.org/pools/150000-aitech-giveaway-free-tokens?completed=true), which offered significant rewards and a high return on investment (ROI).

In addition to standard giveaways, special Incubation Giveaways are organized to celebrate ChainGPT Pad's incubation projects with the community. These giveaways, which often last for a month or more, reward participants with both project tokens and CGPT.&#x20;

Examples of incubation and acceleration giveaways include:

* [Kima](https://pad.chaingpt.org/pools/400000-in-kima-free-token-giveaway-228?completed=true)
* [Cookie3](https://pad.chaingpt.org/pools/240000-in-cookie-free-token-giveaway?completed=true)

Showcasing ChainGPT Pad's commitment to supporting its incubation projects and engaging its community in meaningful ways.

### Launchdrops: A New Path to Token Rewards

Launchdrops are a recent addition to ChainGPT Pad, allowing members to receive free token distributions without participating in an IDO. These distributions are conducted in collaboration with innovative Web3 projects that did not conduct an IDO on ChainGPT Pad but still wish to engage with the community.

#### Eligibility Criteria

* Users must be KYC-verified on ChainGPT Pad.
* Users must have a staked CGPT tier to qualify for allocations.
* Allocation is based on staking points and multipliers, similar to the IDO allocation system.

#### Launchdrop Process

1. Verification: Ensure KYC is completed and wallet is connected.
2. Tier-Based Allocation: Staking in different pools affects the allocation, with higher tiers receiving larger distributions.
3. Token Distribution: Eligible users automatically receive their tokens once the Launchdrop is finalized.
4. Claiming Tokens: Once finalized, users can claim their allocated tokens through their ChainGPT Pad dashboard. Note that a vesting schedule with linear distribution applies, which may vary from one project to another.

#### Key Benefits of Launchdrops

* No prior IDO participation required.
* Exclusive for ChainGPT Pad members with a staked tier.
* Supports promising Web3 projects beyond the IDO framework.
