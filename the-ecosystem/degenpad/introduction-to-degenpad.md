## Announcing DegenPad: A Launchpad Designed by Degens, for Degens <a href="#id-3970" id="id-3970"></a>

Powered by formidable technology developed by [ChainGPT](https://www.chaingpt.org/), DegenPad isn’t just another IDO (Initial DEX Offering) platform — it’s where degens find their edge in Web3.

## What is DegenPad? <a href="#id-12a0" id="id-12a0"></a>

[DegenPad](http://degenpad.com/) is the convergence of Web3 culture and high-stakes crypto. We’re here to demystify DeFi and make it both accessible and fun! Whether you’re a veteran trader or a crypto newcomer, DegenPad is your portal to epic project launches and in-depth Web3 community experiences.

## Inspiration Behind DegenPad <a href="#ec0f" id="ec0f"></a>

At DegenPad, we believe in uncovering diamonds in the rough — promising projects that might be overlooked by the broader market but hold immense potential. Our mission is to give the community access to these hidden gems by focusing on projects that align with emerging market trends, particularly those with low fully diluted valuations (FDVs).

This trend, [as highlighted by Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/research/analysis/low-float-and-high-fdv-how-did-we-get-here) in a recent analysis, reflects a growing awareness of the sustainability challenges faced by tokens with inflated valuations. By focusing on projects with low FDVs, DegenPad aims to offer opportunities that provide upside potential and align with the increasing demand for more sustainable and transparent tokenomics.
