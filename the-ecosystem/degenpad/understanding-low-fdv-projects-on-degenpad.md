Web3 users and traders are constantly looking for projects that offer significant upside potential while minimizing risk. One critical metric that helps gauge a project’s long-term value is Fully Diluted Valuation or FDV. Recently, [even major platforms like Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/research/analysis/low-float-and-high-fdv-how-did-we-get-here) have taken steps to address the challenges posed by high FDV tokens with low circulating supply, underscoring the importance of this metric in creating sustainable market environments.

At [DegenPad](http://degenpad.com/), we’ve recognized the significance of FDV and have made it a cornerstone of our launchpad’s project selection process. This blog will explore what FDV is, why low FDV projects can be highly attractive, and how DegenPad leverages this metric to bring you the most promising opportunities in the Web3 space.

### What is Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV)? <a href="#id-1fdb" id="id-1fdb"></a>

Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) is a metric used to estimate a cryptocurrency project’s potential market capitalization. It considers the tokens currently in circulation and the total number of tokens that could be in circulation if all potential tokens were issued.

This includes tokens reserved for future use, such as those allocated for team members, advisors, or future development activities, and those to be released through staking rewards, airdrops, or other mechanisms.

FDV is calculated by multiplying the total possible supply of a token by its current price. For example, if a project has a maximum supply of 1 million tokens and the current price per token is $10, the FDV would be $10 million. This metric provides a broader view of the project’s potential value, accounting for all tokens that could eventually enter the market.

### Why Focus on Low FDV Projects? <a href="#d605" id="d605"></a>

Low FDV projects are those where the fully diluted valuation is relatively modest compared to the current market capitalization. This can be indicative of several things, including:

1. **Room for Growth**: A low FDV suggests significant room for price appreciation as the project progresses. Participants can benefit from early entry before the broader market fully recognizes the project’s value.
2. **Lower Initial Capitalization**: Projects with low FDV often have a smaller initial market cap, which can attract users looking for undervalued opportunities. This can mean the project is still in its early stages, with plenty of growth potential.
3. **Risk Management**: Low FDV projects might present a lower downside risk relative to their potential upside. This is because the market has not yet fully priced in all future tokens, and the project’s valuation remains relatively conservative.
4. **Incentive for Stakeholders**: For projects with a lower FDV, the founding team and early participants are often more motivated to grow the project, as they hold a significant portion of the total supply that will only be released over time. This alignment of incentives can lead to stronger commitment and better outcomes for all participants.
