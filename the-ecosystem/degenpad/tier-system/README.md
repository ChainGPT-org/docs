Are you ready to access some of the most exclusive and promising crypto startups? [DegenPad](http://degenpad.com/) is your gateway to early-stage investment opportunities, which our team has thoroughly vetted.

To ensure fairness, we‚Äôve implemented a tiered access system that rewards community members who are serious about investing and staking, regardless of their capital size.

**How does the Tier System work?**

The tier system at DegenPad is designed to reward participants based on their level of involvement in our platform. By staking $CGPT tokens, you can earn points that determine your tier, which in turn affects your access to different stages of investment opportunities. The more points you have, the higher your tier, and the greater your benefits.

Whether you have $10 to stake or $20,000, our tier system is balanced to ensure everyone can participate and benefit according to their contributions. However, it‚Äôs important to note that staking points from other products like ChainGPT Pad will only reflect 50% on DegenPad, and vice versa.

**Getting started on DegenPad**\
To join DegenPad and start participating in sales, you need to meet two simple criteria:

* **Complete KYC**: Verify your identity with our KYC partner to keep the platform secure.
* **Stake $CGPT**: Don‚Äôt be a Beta and stake the required amount of $CGPT to earn points and qualify for at least the Ape tier.

**Staking $CGPT**\
Staking $CGPT tokens is a way of showing your commitment to the DegenPad ecosystem. By staking, you unlock access to various utilities and begin accumulating points that determine your tier level.\
1 staked $CGPT = 1 tier point

Staking is divided into four pools based on time frames, each with its own point multiplier:

* 45 days = 1x multiplier
* 90 days = 1.3x multiplier
* 180 days = 1.5x multiplier
* 365 days = 2x multiplier

The longer you stake, the more points you earn, which boosts your tier status and rewards.

**Point System**\
The point system is the backbone of our tier structure. It calculates your participation impact based on the amount of $CGPT staked and the duration of your stake.

Total $CGPT tokens staked √ó pool multiplier = Tier Points

For example:

* Staking 1,000 $CGPT in the 45-day pool gives you 1,000 points.
* Staking 1,000 $CGPT in the 90-day pool gives you 1,300 points.
* Staking 1,000 $CGPT in the 180-day pool gives you 1,500 points.
* Staking 1,000 $CGPT in the 365-day pool gives you 2,000 points.

**Tier System**\
DegenPad features four tiers, each offering unique benefits. As you stake more $CGPT and accumulate points, you can climb the tiers and gain access to better opportunities.

**Note on Tier Allocation Multiplier**\
The Ape tier has a fixed 1x multiplier, regardless of points. However, in the Chad, Shark, and Whale tiers, the multiplier scales with your points within the tier. For example:

* A Chad with 20,000 points has a 4x multiplier, while one with 35,000 points has a 7x multiplier.
* A Shark with 50,000 points has a 10x multiplier, while one with 100,000 points has a 20x multiplier.
* A Whale with 200,000 points has a 40x multiplier, while one with 400,000 points may have a 50x multiplier.

The Whale tier has a theoretically limitless capacity, and multipliers are adjusted based on the final outcome of each IDO.
