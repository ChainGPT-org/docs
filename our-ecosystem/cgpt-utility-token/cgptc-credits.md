### What is CGPTc?

**CGPTc**, or **ChainGPT Credits**, are the units of account and consumption for the ChainGPT ecosystem applications. Every function processed through the ChainGPT AI model requires computational resources. To properly value and account for this usage, ChainGPT employs the CGPTc system—a stable, credit-based structure that ensures predictable and fair pricing for users.

This fundamental unit serves as a direct measure of a user’s current **buying power** within the ChainGPT ecosystem.

### What is the value of CGPTc?

To ensure maximum simplicity and transparency for users, the value of CGPTc is **pegged at a fixed rate**:

> **1 CGPTc = $0.01 USD**

This stable value holds regardless of the real-time market fluctuations of the $CGPT token. Once $CGPT is converted into CGPTc, the purchasing power remains consistent and predictable across all tools, services, and API usage.

### How to Acquire CGPTc

CGPTc is acquired by **directly converting $CGPT tokens** within the ChainGPT application.

Upon entering the ChainGPT application suite, users connect their Web3 wallets. Once connected, the dashboard (top-right corner, near the account/address settings) displays your current CGPTc balance.

By clicking the balance display, a modal window will appear, prompting users to initiate a token exchange to convert $CGPT into CGPTc.

**\*Be advised:** _All $CGPT to CGPTc conversions are final. There is no way to undo or trade out of CGPTc back into $CGPT tokens. This is a one-way action._&#x20;
