DegenPad leverages a two-phased approach for conducting the launches of IDO projects.&#x20;

By having multiple rounds, a higher degree of commitment from the CGPT user base can be established, and a larger potential opportunity for projects to successfully complete their intended sales.&#x20;

### **Round #1 (Guaranteed Allocation)**

Round one of an IDO will be granted only to the users who signal their desire to participate by registering their interest prior to the start of the IDO. (Typicall&#x79;_, Registration will open a week prior and last until 24 hours before launch_).

This round is reserved for the top staking tier groups, Silver, Gold, and Diamond. However, every IDO is launched through social campaigns that allow a limited group of fast-acting Bronze tier members to earn their inclusion into the guaranteed round.

Round #1 will last for 24 hours unless otherwise specified.

### **Round #2 (FCFS - First Come First Serve)**

Round two, the First Come First Serve, is open to the broader ChainGPT community. There is no requirement to register interest for FCFS; however, waiting for it runs the risk of users being unable to participate due to early completion. Here, all KYC tier members can join at will.

Round #2 will last for 12 hours unless otherwise specified.

_Should a project reach 99% of its maximum IDO capacity during the first round of guaranteed allocations, the IDO will immediately conclude the first round. At least 1% of the capacity will always be reserved for the second round, designated for First Come, First Serve (FCFS) participants._
