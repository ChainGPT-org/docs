[DegenPad](http://degenpad.com/) has been designed with maximum security considerations for its users. To mitigate risks, protect against malicious activity, and ensure that projects listed on the platform behave with integrity, DegenPad has implemented a novel refund policy.

### How Our Refund Policy Works <a href="#c38d" id="c38d"></a>

Following the successful completion of an IDO and the project’s token initial listing, the refund grace period begins.

During the refund grace period, DegenPad users will have two options in their dashboard: “Claim” and “Refund.” At any point within the grace period, users have the right to withdraw from participation by simply selecting “Refund.” Once a user confirms a refund, their initial contributions will be released directly back to their wallet addresses.

Please note that if a user selects “Claim” at any point, they will collect their token allocation and, by default, will no longer be able to refund it.

Every IDO on the DegenPad platform undergoes a qualitative assessment before listing, which will determine the length of the refund grace period. Typically, this period spans 7 days, but under certain circumstances, the DegenPad team may adjust it as needed.

### Refund Qualification <a href="#b501" id="b501"></a>

Every participant tier, from Ape to Whale, qualifies for a 100% refund on their committed funds, as long as they make their request within the allotted refund period and do not claim before the period expires.

### Conclusion <a href="#id-1f19" id="id-1f19"></a>

The presence of a refund policy is intended to protect the DegenPad community while incentivizing participating projects to operate with maximum integrity.

## Refund Policy FAQs: <a href="#f147" id="f147"></a>

**1) For how long can I request a Refund?**\
As long as you do not “Claim” within the refund grace period, you can request a refund anytime before the grace period elapses.

**2) Do I get a full refund?**\
Yes, refunds are 100% of your allocation.

**3) Can I request a refund after I “Claim”?**\
No, by opting to claim, you forfeit the right to refunds.

**4) How is this beneficial to projects?**\
With a refund policy in place, projects are provided with solid guidelines by which they must abide in order to offer the highest level of service to users. It acts as an automated security shield. With these guardrails in place, projects of lower quality will be discouraged from attempting to infiltrate our community.
