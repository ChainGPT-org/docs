### Generation Options

The ChainGPT AI NFT Generator offers two distinct formats for generating NFTs:

#### Option 1: Single NFT

This option is best suited for results that require individual, specific attention. Whether you are an artist expressing your thoughts or a business in need of abstract imagery, the Single NFT generator can cater to complex demands and deliver high-quality results.

#### Option 2: Collection

The Collection option is optimized for use cases that require large batches of unique art. Prominent applications include ticketing and community building. Rather than mass-printing redundant copies of tickets, you can provide your audience with distinguishable designs for their tickets. When building communities, generating collections from a single prompt ensures a visual bond that unites all members under the same principle.

* Collection size varies with a maximum cap of 10,000 images per request.

### Prompting

The ChainGPT AI NFT Generator is designed to complement abstract thinking and bring arbitrary concepts to life. There is no hardcoded universal framework for perfect prompting; the best prompts are those that produce the desired results. However, providing accurate and descriptive prompts generally leads to more accurate outcomes.

Prompts can range from concrete and straightforward examples like "White Rhino In Space" to more abstract ones such as "Obsidian God Wearing Jewelry in a Mansion." Feel free to experiment and explore the generator to understand how it interprets your ideas.

* Spelling and grammar: Don't worry, the ChainGPT AI model is advanced and can comprehend linguistic nuances.
