### **ChainGPT Beta vs. Official Version**

ChainGPT Beta is already here, and It's free. It's the pilot version of ChainGPT AI, and it's extremely capable.

The official version is trained on much more data than the beta version, with more capabilities when it comes to programming, is connected to the internet, can read blockchain live data, and much more!&#x20;
