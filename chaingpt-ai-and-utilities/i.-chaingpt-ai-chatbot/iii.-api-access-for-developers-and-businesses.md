# III. API Access for Developers & Businesses

Using ChainGPT's SDK and API access, developers and businesses can seamlessly integrate our cutting-edge AI model into their platforms and applications. In addition, the SDK and API provide a comprehensive toolset for developers to craft unique solutions based on ChainGPT's AI model. Payments are conveniently made via $CGPT tokens on a per-request basis.

At ChainGPT, we make our powerful AI accessible to individuals and businesses alike. For individual users, access to the AI can be obtained either by paying per request with $CGPT tokens or by staking a minimum of 1000 $CGPT tokens for unlimited access. On the other hand, **businesses and developers must stake a specified number of $CGPT tokens**, which will be automatically deducted for each AI request made on the client side. The staked tokens can be easily removed or added anytime, providing flexible control over the available funds. Furthermore, each submission will deduct the corresponding $CGPT tokens from the staked balance, ensuring smooth and seamless AI services.
