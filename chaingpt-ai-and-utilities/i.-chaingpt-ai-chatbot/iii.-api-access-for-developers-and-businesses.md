# III. API Access for Developers & Businesses

With the utilization of ChainGPT's SDK and API access, developers and businesses can seamlessly integrate our cutting-edge AI model into their platforms and applications. The SDK and API provide a comprehensive toolset for developers to craft unique solutions based on ChainGPT's AI model, and payments are conveniently made via $GPT tokens on a per-request basis.

At ChainGPT, we make our powerful AI accessible to individuals and businesses alike. For individual users, access to the AI can be obtained either by paying per request with $GPT tokens or by staking a minimum of 1000 $GPT tokens for unlimited access. On the other hand, **businesses and developers are required to stake a specified number of $GPT tokens**, which will be automatically deducted for each AI request made on the client side. The staked tokens can be easily removed or added at any time, providing flexible control over the available funds. With each request, the corresponding $GPT tokens will be deducted from the staked balance, ensuring smooth and seamless AI services.
