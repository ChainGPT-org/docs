# A. Your Guide for Blockchain & Crypto Topics

Having ChainGPT AI, is like having a personal software engineer in your pocket. \
But you must learn how to craft prompts for code generation.\
Here's how you can get AI to write software for you:

"I am building a project in <mark style="background-color:green;">Solidity</mark>. The description of the project is below:\
I want a <mark style="background-color:orange;">smart-contract for a token</mark>. Called <mark style="background-color:purple;">ChainGPT, with the symbol $GPT, total fixed supply of 10,000 tokens, and 2% tax from each transaction sent to the owner</mark> of the token. \
<mark style="background-color:red;">Your task is to provide a code</mark> with all the requests above, and no bugs.\
<mark style="background-color:blue;">In your response provide all the code with notes and explanation of each function.</mark>"

<mark style="background-color:green;">Green</mark> = Language / framework\
<mark style="background-color:orange;">Orange</mark> = Development\
<mark style="background-color:purple;">Purple</mark> = Functions\
<mark style="background-color:red;">Red</mark> = Assignment\
<mark style="background-color:blue;">Blue</mark> = Response structure



You can apply similar structure for code debugging, code auditing, documentation creation, and many other solutions and usecases. Learn more about specific prompt engineering in the next pages.
