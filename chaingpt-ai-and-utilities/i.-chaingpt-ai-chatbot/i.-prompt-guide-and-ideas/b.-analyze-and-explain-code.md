# B. Analyze & Explain Code

## Introduction to ChainGPT

ChainGPT is a revolutionary new way to make smart contracts and code accessible to non-developers. By utilizing advanced AI-driven technology, ChainGPT can audit any code, program, or smart-contract within seconds, and provide an easy-to-understand explanation of what each function / smart contract is meant to do. Furthermore, ChainGPT has developed a browser extension called "Dev Assist" which helps users with live web3 transactions and explains what they are about to agree to before they confirm the transaction.

### How ChainGPT Works

ChainGPT uses AI-driven technology to scan any code, program, or smart-contract. Once the scan is complete, ChainGPT provides a clear, concise explanation of what each function / smart contract is supposed to do. This makes it extremely easy for non-developers to understand the purpose and function of a smart contract.

### Example

To demonstrate the power of ChainGPT, we asked it to explain the ‘BSCValidatorSet’ contract on Binance Smart Chain. In seconds, we received a clear, concise response. Here’s the response from ChainGPT:

"BSCValidatorSet is a smart contract that allows users to manage validator sets on Binance Smart Chain. It allows users to add, remove, and view validator sets, as well as query the current validator set."

### Conclusion

ChainGPT is a revolutionary AI-driven blockchain technology that helps make smart contracts and code accessible to non-developers. With ChainGPT, users can audit any code, program, or smart-contract within seconds and understand what each function / smart contract is supposed to do. Furthermore, the "Dev Assist" browser extension helps users with live web3 transactions and explains what they are about to agree to before they confirm the transaction. This makes ChainGPT a game-changer for non-programmers in the blockchain world, allowing them to fully understand what they’re agreeing to in a smart contract.
