# II. Access & Pricing

**ChainGPT beta is now out** and **free**; try it: [https://app.chaingpt.org](https://app.chaingpt.org).

We offer flexible pricing plans for any individual, business, or developer to make ChainGPT accessible for everyone. We currently offer three pricing plans: Beta, Priority, and Advanced.

* **Beta**: Beta is already here, and It's free! With beta, you get free access to ChainGPT AI, limited calls, slower response rate, and the AI may only sometimes be available for you.
* **Priority**: Individuals must pay 5 $CGPT tokens with each request for priority access. The benefits of importance are that we will always prioritize your requests over beta, but limitations may applyâ€”medium response rate. Access to AI will always be available.
* **Advanced**: For advanced access, individuals must stake 1000 $CGPT tokens in exchange for free and unlimited access to ChainGPT. The staked tokens can be withdrawn at any time. No limitation (0% downtime), Ultra-fast response rate, and 24/7 AI availability are guaranteed.
