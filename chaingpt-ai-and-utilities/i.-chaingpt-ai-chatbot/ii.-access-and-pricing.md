# II. Access & Pricing

**ChainGPT beta is now out**, and It's **free**, try it: [https://app.chaingpt.org](https://app.chaingpt.org)

We offer flexible pricing plans for any individual, business, or developer, to make ChainGPT accessible for everyone. We currently offer three pricing plans: Beta, Priority, and Advanced.

* **Beta**: Beta is already here, and It's free! With beta you get free access to ChainGPT AI, limited calls, slower response rate, and the AI may not always be available for you.
* **Priority**: For priority access individuals must pay 5 $GPT tokens with each request. The benefits of priority are: we will always prioritize your requests over beta, but limitations may still apply. Medium response rate. Access to the AI will always be available.
* **Advanced**: For advanced access indivduals must stake 1000 $GPT tokens, in exchange for free and unlimited access to ChainGPT. The staked tokens can be withdrawn at any time. No limitation (0% downtime), Ultra-fast response rate, and 24/7 AI availability is guaranteed.
