# Initial Ecosystem

The ChainGPT blockchain is an open-source blockchain designed to provide a secure and efficient platform for AI smart-contracts and models. The initial ecosystem includes a suite of utilities and decentralized applications (DApps) developed by the ChainGPT engineering team.&#x20;

This suite of utilities and DApps includes:

<details>

<summary>AI Models &#x26; Tools Marketplace</summary>

The ChainGPT AI Models & Tools Marketplace is a decentralized marketplace for AI models and tools. This marketplace allows developers to easily upload and share their AI models and tools with the ChainGPT community. Users can also buy and sell models and tools in the marketplace.
