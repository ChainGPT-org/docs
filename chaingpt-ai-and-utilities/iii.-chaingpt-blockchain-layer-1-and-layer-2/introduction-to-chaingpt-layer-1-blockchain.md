## Introduction to ChainGPT Layer-1 Blockchain

The world of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence is evolving rapidly, and organizations must keep up with the latest advancements to remain competitive. The advent of ChainGPT, the next-generation virtual machine, offers a unique combination of EVM compatibility and on-chain AI inference.

### ChainGPT Virtual Machine

The CGVM is EVM-compatible, which means it is built to be backward-compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. However, it also supports on-chain AI inference, which allows it to execute complex AI models using the GPU instead of the CPU. This enhances the performance and scalability of the platform, making it an ideal solution for organizations looking to harness the power of AI and blockchain technology.

### AI Inference Engine

The deterministic AI inference engine, Synapse, is the backbone of the ChainGPT platform. It guarantees that the AI inference results are identical across heterogenetic computing environments. This means developers can rely on consistent and accurate results, eliminating the need for off-chain solutions.

### AI Smart Contract and AI DApp

ChainGPT adds machine learning support to smart contracts and DApps, allowing developers to create AI-enhanced applications that adapt to real-world use cases. The platform supports the popular Solidity programming language and provides access to a wide range of off-the-shelf AI models stored on the ChainGPT storage layer. This enables developers to create cutting-edge applications that deliver significant value to users.

### Decentralizing AI Research

ChainGPT seeks to foster an open-source ecosystem where AI researchers and developers are incentivized to share their models with the world. By doing so, the platform can foster innovation and collaboration in AI research, making it easier for organizations to access cutting-edge AI models and solutions.



The ChainGPT virtual machine offers a unique combination of EVM compatibility and on-chain AI inference, making it an ideal solution for organizations looking to harness the power of AI and blockchain technology. In addition, the deterministic AI inference engine and the support for AI-enhanced smart contracts and DApps make it an attractive platform for developers and researchers. By fostering an open-source ecosystem for AI research, ChainGPT has the potential to drive innovation and collaboration in AI.
